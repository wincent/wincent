At a high level, this is how to use AWS Data Exchange as a provider:

Potential provider registers to be a provider ‚Äì Registering allows you to list products on AWS Data Exchange and make them available on AWS Marketplace. For more information, see Step 2: Register to be a provider.

The data is eligible to be published on AWS Data Exchange ‚Äì You're limited to distributing data sets that meet the legal eligibility requirements set forth in the Terms and Conditions for AWS Marketplace Sellers. For more information about the types of permitted data, see Publishing guidelines.

Provider creates a data set, a revision, and imports assets ‚Äì You can create data sets through the AWS Data Exchange console or API. Then, you can create revisions in the data set, and add assets to that revision. For more information, see Data in AWS Data Exchange.

Provider creates a product and its offer ‚Äì To create a product, you must provide product details, include one or more data sets, and optionally provide public offer details. For more information, see Publishing a new product.

Products containing Files (Amazon S3 Objects) ‚Äì When an owned data set containing Amazon S3 objects is published in a product, AWS Data Exchange creates a copy of the data set. Subscribers can access that copy of the data set as an entitled data set.

Products containing Amazon API Gateway APIs ‚Äì When an owned data set containing Amazon API Gateway APIs is published in a product, AWS Data Exchange allows requests to the AWS Data Exchange endpoint to proxy through to your Amazon API Gateway API. Subscribers can view the API and download the API specification as an entitled data set. Subscribers can also call the API through the AWS Data Exchange console.

Products containing Amazon Redshift data sets ‚Äì When an owned data set containing Amazon Redshift data sets is published in a product, AWS Data Exchange allows requests to the AWS Data Exchange endpoint to proxy through to your Amazon Redshift datashare. Subscribers can have read-only access to the tables, views, schemas, and user-defined functions that you've added to the datashare.

Products containing Amazon S3 data access (Preview) ‚Äì When an owned data set containing Amazon S3 data access is published in a product, AWS Data Exchange allows subscribers the same Amazon S3 objects that the data provider maintains. This approach provides the most current data available. Providers share direct access to an Amazon S3 bucket or specific prefix and Amazon S3 objects and use AWS Data Exchange to manage subscriptions, entitlements, billing, and payment.

Products containing AWS Lake Formation data sets (Preview) ‚Äì When an owned data set containing Lake Formation data permission data sets is published in a product, AWS Data Exchange grants read-only access to the data associated with the LF-tags you included in the data set. Subscribers can subscribe to the databases, tables, or columns that you share with them with downstream query services integrated with Lake Formation such as Amazon Athena and Redshift Spectrum.

(Optional) Provider enables subscription verification ‚Äì If you enable subscription verification, subscribers must request a subscription to your product. This gives you an opportunity to review potential subscribers before they access your data sets. For more information, see Subscription verification for providers.

(Optional) Provider creates custom offers for the product ‚Äì In addition to a public offer, you can create custom offers, including private and Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) offers, for select customers. For more information, see Creating custom offers.

(Optional) Provider publishes new revision ‚Äì You can update dynamic data sets over time by creating a new revision using the AWS Data Exchange API or console. These revisions can then be published. For more information, see Revisions or Updating products.

Provider reviews reports through the AWS Marketplace Management Portal ‚Äì Reports are available to all registered AWS Marketplace sellers and are released on a regular cadence (daily, weekly, or monthly). For more information, see Provider financials on AWS Marketplace.

Provider receives funds distributed by AWS Marketplace ‚Äì For more information, see Provider financials on AWS Marketplace.

Extended Provider Program (EPP)
The Extended Provider Program (EPP) is a program for qualiÔ¨Åed data providers to publish data products containing sensitive categories of personal information and/or personal information that is not otherwise publicly available.

Providers seeking to participate in the EPP must complete an additional review process by the AWS Data Exchange team. For more information about eligibility for the Extended Provider Program, send an email message to <aws-data-exchange-support@amazon.com>.

For more information about publishing guidelines for data providers who are enrolled in the EPP, see Publishing guidelines.

Programmatic access
If you're using AWS Data Exchange programmatically, there are two different sets of resources with two different APIs:

AWS Data Exchange API ‚Äì Use these API operations to create, view, update, and delete data sets and revisions. You can also use these API operations to import and export assets to and from those revisions. For more information, see the AWS Data Exchange API Reference.

AWS Marketplace Catalog API ‚Äì Used by providers to view and update products on AWS Data Exchange and AWS Marketplace. For more information, see the AWS Marketplace Catalog API Reference.

Before you become a data product provider on AWS Data Exchange, review the following topic:

The following topics describe routing for specific gateways or connections in your VPC.

Contents

Routing to an internet gateway
Routing to a NAT device
Routing to a virtual private gateway
Routing to an AWS Outposts local gateway
Routing to a VPC peering connection
Routing to a gateway VPC endpoint
Routing to an egress-only internet gateway
Routing for a transit gateway

Routing using a prefix list
Routing to a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint
Routing to an internet gateway
You can make a subnet a public subnet by adding a route in your subnet route table to an internet gateway. To do this, create and attach an internet gateway to your VPC, and then add a route with a destination of 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 traffic or ::/0 for IPv6 traffic, and a target of the internet gateway ID (igw-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).

Destination	Target
0.0.0.0/0	igw-id
::/0	igw-id
For more information, see Connect to the internet using an internet gateway.

Routing to a NAT device
To enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet, you can create a NAT gateway or launch a NAT instance in a public subnet. Then add a route for the private subnet's route table that routes IPv4 internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT device.

Destination	Target
0.0.0.0/0	nat-gateway-id
You can also create more specific routes to other targets to avoid unnecessary data processing charges for using a NAT gateway, or to route certain traffic privately. In the following example, Amazon S3 traffic (pl-xxxxxxxx; a specific IP address range for Amazon S3) is routed to a gateway VPC endpoint, and 10.25.0.0/16 traffic is routed to a VPC peering connection. The pl-xxxxxxxx and 10.25.0.0/16 IP address ranges are more specific than 0.0.0.0/0. When instances send traffic to Amazon S3 or the peer VPC, the traffic is sent to the gateway VPC endpoint or the VPC peering connection. All other traffic is sent to the NAT gateway.

Destination	Target
0.0.0.0/0	nat-gateway-id
pl-xxxxxxxx	vpce-id
10.25.0.0/16	pcx-id
For more information, see NAT gateways and NAT instances. NAT devices cannot be used for IPv6 traffic.

Routing to a virtual private gateway
You can use an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to enable instances in your VPC to communicate with your own network. To do this, create and attach a virtual private gateway to your VPC. Then add a route in your subnet route table with the destination of your network and a target of the virtual private gateway (vgw-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).

Destination	Target
10.0.0.0/16	vgw-id
You can then create and configure your Site-to-Site VPN connection. For more information, see What is AWS Site-to-Site VPN? and Route tables and VPN route priority in the AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.

A Site-to-Site VPN connection on a virtual private gateway does not support IPv6 traffic. However, we support IPv6 traffic routed through a virtual private gateway to an AWS Direct Connect connection. For more information, see the AWS Direct Connect User Guide.

Routing to an AWS Outposts local gateway
Subnets that are in VPCs associated with AWS Outposts can have an additional target type of a local gateway. Consider the case where you want to have the local gateway route traffic with a destination address of 192.168.10.0/24 to the customer network. To do this, add the following route with the destination network and a target of the local gateway (lgw-xxxx).

Destination	Target
192.168.10.0/24	lgw-id
Routing to a VPC peering connection
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that allows you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are part of the same network.

To enable the routing of traffic between VPCs in a VPC peering connection, you must add a route to one or more of your subnet route tables that points to the VPC peering connection. This allows you to access all or part of the CIDR block of the other VPC in the peering connection. Similarly, the owner of the other VPC must add a route to their subnet route table to route traffic back to your VPC.

For example, you have a VPC peering connection (pcx-11223344556677889) between two VPCs, with the following information:

VPC A: CIDR block is 10.0.0.0/16

VPC B: CIDR block is 172.31.0.0/16

To enable traffic between the VPCs and allow access to the entire IPv4 CIDR block of either VPC, the VPC A route table is configured as follows.

Destination	Target
10.0.0.0/16	Local
172.31.0.0/16	pcx-11223344556677889
The VPC B route table is configured as follows.

Destination	Target
172.31.0.0/16	Local
10.0.0.0/16	pcx-11223344556677889
Your VPC peering connection can also support IPv6 communication between instances in the VPCs, if the VPCs and instances are enabled for IPv6 communication. To enable the routing of IPv6 traffic between VPCs, you must add a route to your route table that points to the VPC peering connection to access all or part of the IPv6 CIDR block of the peer VPC.

For example, using the same VPC peering connection (pcx-11223344556677889) above, assume the VPCs have the following information:

VPC A: IPv6 CIDR block is 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56

VPC B: IPv6 CIDR block is 2001:db8:5678:2b00::/56

To enable IPv6 communication over the VPC peering connection, add the following route to the subnet route table for VPC A.

Destination	Target
10.0.0.0/16	Local
172.31.0.0/16	pcx-11223344556677889
2001:db8:5678:2b00::/56	pcx-11223344556677889
Add the following route to the route table for VPC B.

Destination	Target
172.31.0.0/16	Local
10.0.0.0/16	pcx-11223344556677889
2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56	pcx-11223344556677889
For more information about VPC peering connections, see the Amazon VPC Peering Guide.

Routing to a gateway VPC endpoint
A gateway VPC endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and another AWS service. When you create a gateway endpoint, you specify the subnet route tables in your VPC that are used by the gateway endpoint. A route is automatically added to each of the route tables with a destination that specifies the prefix list ID of the service (pl-xxxxxxxx), and a target with the endpoint ID (vpce-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx). You cannot explicitly delete or modify the endpoint route, but you can change the route tables that are used by the endpoint.

For more information about routing for endpoints, and the implications for routes to AWS services, see Routing for gateway endpoints.

Routing to an egress-only internet gateway
You can create an egress-only internet gateway for your VPC to enable instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound communication to the internet, but prevent the internet from initiating connections with the instances. An egress-only internet gateway is used for IPv6 traffic only. To configure routing for an egress-only internet gateway, add a route in the private subnet's route table that routes IPv6 internet traffic (::/0) to the egress-only internet gateway.

Destination	Target
::/0	eigw-id
For more information, see Enable outbound IPv6 traffic using an egress-only internet gateway.

Routing for a transit gateway
When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, you need to add a route to your subnet route table for traffic to route through the transit gateway.

Consider the following scenario where you have three VPCs that are attached to a transit gateway. In this scenario, all attachments are associated with the transit gateway route table and propagate to the transit gateway route table. Therefore, all attachments can route packets to each other, with the transit gateway serving as a simple layer 3 IP hub.

For example, you have two VPCs, with the following information:

VPC A: 10.1.0.0/16, attachment ID tgw-attach-11111111111111111

VPC B: 10.2.0.0/16, attachment ID tgw-attach-22222222222222222

To enable traffic between the VPCs and allow access to the transit gateway, the VPC A route table is configured as follows.

Destination	Target
10.1.0.0/16	local
10.0.0.0/8	tgw-id
The following is an example of the transit gateway route table entries for the VPC attachments.

Destination	Target
10.1.0.0/16	tgw-attach-11111111111111111
10.2.0.0/16	tgw-attach-22222222222222222
For more information about transit gateway route tables, see Routing in Amazon VPC Transit Gateways.

Routing for a middlebox appliance
You can add middlebox appliances into the routing paths for your VPC. The following are possible use cases:

Intercept traffic that enters your VPC through an internet gateway or a virtual private gateway by directing it to a middlebox appliance in your VPC. You can use the middlebox routing wizard to have AWS automatically configure the appropriate route tables for your gateway, middlebox, and destination subnet. For more information, see Middlebox routing wizard.

Direct traffic between two subnets to a middlebox appliance. You can do so by creating a route for one subnet route table that matches the subnet CIDR of the other subnet and specifies a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, NAT gateway, Network Firewall endpoint, or the network interface for an appliance as a target. Alternatively, to redirect all traffic from the subnet to any other subnet, replace the target of the local route with a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, NAT gateway, or network interface.

You can configure the appliance to suit your needs. For example, you can configure a security appliance that screens all traffic, or a WAN acceleration appliance. The appliance is deployed as an Amazon EC2 instance in a subnet in your VPC, and is represented by an elastic network interface (network interface) in your subnet.

If you enable route propagation for the destination subnet route table, be aware of route priority. We prioritize the most specific route, and if the routes match, we prioritize static routes over propagated routes. Review your routes to ensure that traffic is routed correctly and that there are no unintended consequences if you enable or disable route propagation (for example, route propagation is required for an AWS Direct Connect connection that supports jumbo frames).

To route inbound VPC traffic to an appliance, you associate a route table with the internet gateway or virtual private gateway, and specify the network interface of your appliance as the target for VPC traffic. For more information, see Gateway route tables. You can also route outbound traffic from your subnet to a middlebox appliance in another subnet.

For middlebox routing examples, see Middlebox scenarios.

Appliance considerations
Routing traffic between a gateway and an appliance
Routing inter-subnet traffic to an appliance
Appliance considerations
You can choose a third-party appliance from AWS Marketplace, or you can configure your own appliance. When you create or configure an appliance, take note of the following:

The appliance must be configured in a separate subnet to the source or destination traffic.

You must disable source/destination checking on the appliance. For more information, see Changing the Source or Destination Checking in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

You cannot route traffic between hosts in the same subnet through an appliance.

The appliance does not have to perform network address translation (NAT).

You can add a route to your route tables that is more specific than the local route. You can use more specific routes to redirect traffic between subnets within a VPC (East-West traffic) to a middlebox appliance. The destination of the route must match the entire IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block of a subnet in your VPC.

To intercept IPv6 traffic, ensure that you configure your VPC, subnet, and appliance for IPv6. For more information, see Work with VPCs. Virtual private gateways do not support IPv6 traffic.

Routing traffic between a gateway and an appliance
To route inbound VPC traffic to an appliance, you associate a route table with the internet gateway or virtual private gateway, and specify the network interface of your appliance as the target for VPC traffic. In the following example, the VPC has an internet gateway, an appliance, and a subnet with instances. Traffic from the internet is routed through an appliance.


                    Routing inbound traffic through an appliance
                
Associate this route table with your internet gateway or virtual private gateway. The first entry is the local route. The second entry sends IPv4 traffic destined for the subnet to the network interface for the appliance. This route is more specific than the local route.

Destination	Target
VPC CIDR	Local
Subnet CIDR	Appliance network interface ID
Alternatively, you can replace the target for the local route with the network interface of the appliance. You can do this to ensure that all traffic is automatically routed to the appliance, including traffic destined for subnets that you add to the VPC in the future.

Destination	Target
VPC CIDR	Appliance network interface ID
To route traffic from your subnet to an appliance in another subnet, add a route to your subnet route table that routes traffic to the appliance's network interface. The destination must be less specific than the destination for the local route. For example, for traffic destined for the internet, specify 0.0.0.0/0 (all IPv4 addresses) for the destination.

Destination	Target
VPC CIDR	Local
0.0.0.0/0	Appliance network interface ID
Then, in the route table associated with the appliance's subnet, add a route that sends the traffic back to the internet gateway or virtual private gateway.

Destination	Target
VPC CIDR	Local
0.0.0.0/0	igw-id
Routing inter-subnet traffic to an appliance
You can route traffic destined for a specific subnet to the network interface of an appliance. In the following example, the VPC contains two subnets and an appliance. Traffic between the subnets is routed through an appliance.


                    Routing traffic between subnets through an appliance
                
Security groups
When you route traffic between instances in different subnets through a middlebox appliance, the security groups for both instances must allow traffic to flow between the instances. The security group for each instance must reference the private IP address of the other instance, or the CIDR range of the subnet that contains the other instance, as the source. If you reference the security group of the other instance as the source, this does not allow traffic to flow between the instances.

Routing
The following is an example route table for subnet A. The first entry enables instances in the VPC to communicate with each other. The second entry routes all traffic from subnet A to subnet B to the network interface of the appliance.

Destination	Target
VPC CIDR	Local
Subnet B CIDR	Appliance network interface ID
The following is an example route table for subnet B. The first entry enables instances in the VPC to communicate with each other. The second entry routes all traffic from subnet B to subnet A to the network interface of the appliance.

Destination	Target
VPC CIDR	Local
Subnet A CIDR	Appliance network interface ID
Alternatively, you can replace the target for the local route with the network interface of the appliance. You can do this to ensure that all traffic is automatically routed to the appliance, including traffic destined for subnets that you add to the VPC in the future.

Destination	Target
VPC CIDR	Appliance network interface ID
Routing using a prefix list
If you frequently reference the same set of CIDR blocks across your AWS resources, you can create a customer-managed prefix list to group them together. You can then specify the prefix list as the destination in your route table entry. You can later add or remove entries for the prefix list without needing to update your route tables.

For example, you have a transit gateway with multiple VPC attachments. The VPCs must be able to communicate with two specific VPC attachments that have the following CIDR blocks:

10.0.0.0/16

10.2.0.0/16

You create a prefix list with both entries. In your subnet route tables, you create a route and specify the prefix list as the destination, and the transit gateway as the target.

Destination	Target
172.31.0.0/16	Local
pl-123abc123abc123ab	tgw-id
The maximum number of entries for the prefix lists equals the same number of entries in the route table.

Routing to a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint
A Gateway Load Balancer enables you to distribute traffic to a fleet of virtual appliances, such as firewalls. You can configure the load balancer as a service by creating a VPC endpoint service configuration. You then create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint in your VPC to connect your VPC to the service.

To route your traffic to the Gateway Load Balancer (for example, for security inspection), specify the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint as a target in your route tables.

For an example of a security appliances behind a Gateway Load Balancer, see Inspect traffic using appliances in a security VPC.

To specify the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint in the route table, use the ID of the VPC endpoint. For example to route traffic for 10.0.1.0/24 to a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, add the following route.

Destination	Target
10.0.1.0/24	vpc-endpoint-id
For more information, see Gateway Load Balancers.

Windows
This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

Regular Expressions: Windows uses \r\n for line endings, while Unix-based systems use \n. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use \r?\n instead of \n in order to support both environments. The Node.js os.EOL property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
Paths: Windows systems use \ for the path separator, which would be returned by path.join and others. You could use path.posix, path.posix.join etc and the slash module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write scripts in JavaScript instead of Bash.
Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with msys. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
Update Git configuration: git config --system core.longpaths true

# Changelog
## 2021-11-11

## 2021-07-10
