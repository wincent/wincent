INTRO                                                           *pinnacle-intro*

Pinnacle provides functions for manipulating |:highlight| groups in Vimscript
(eg. |pinnacle#italicize|) and Lua (eg. `require'wincent.pinnacle'.italicize()`).

INSTALLATION                                             *pinnacle-installation*

To install Pinnacle, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice", I recommend
Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and
that you want to install Pinnacle into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with:
>
    git clone https://github.com/wincent/pinnacle.git ~/.vim/bundle/pinnacle
<
Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject:
>
    git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/pinnacle.git ~/vim/bundle/pinnacle
    git submodule init
<
To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with:
>
    :call pathogen#helptags()
<
FUNCTIONS                                                   *pinnacle-functions*

pinnacle#sub_newlines() ~

Replaces newlines with spaces.

Note that this function is not implemented in the Lua API, because it is
required only for support on legacy Vim versions.

pinnacle#capture_line() ~

Runs a command and returns the captured output as a single line.

Useful when we don't want to let long lines on narrow windows produce
unwanted embedded newlines.

Note that this function is not implemented in the Lua API, because it is
required only for support on legacy Vim versions.

HISTORY                                                       *pinnacle-history*

main (not yet released) ~

- Taught `pinnacle#decorate()` to accept a comma-separated list of styles.
- Added alternative Lua-based API (eg. `require'wincent.pinnacle'.italicize()`
  is equivalent to `pinnacle#italicize()` etc); but note:
- Removed functions that aren't needed in the Lua API:
  `pinnacle.extract_bg()`, `pinnacle.capture_highlight()`,
  `pinnacle.extract_component()`, `pinnacle.extract_fg()`,
  `pinnacle.extract_highlight()`, and `pinnacle.highlight()`. Equivalent
  functionality can be obtained by using the convenience functions listed
  below, along with `pinnacle.decorate()` and `pinnacle.dump()`.
- Added convenience functions for common operations to the Lua API:
  `pinnacle.bg()`, `pinnacle.clear()`, `pinnacle.fg()`, `pinnacle.link()`,
  `pinnacle.merge()`, and `pinnacle.set()`.
- Added utility functions to the Lua API: `pinnacle.adjust_lightness()`,
  `pinnacle.brighten()` and `pinnacle.darken()`.

1.0 (6 March 2019) ~

- Added `pinnacle#dump()`.

0.3.1 (7 June 2017) ~

- Fix another bug with augmentation of existing highlights.

0.3 (6 June 2017) ~

- Fixed bug that could cause existing highlights to be incorrectly augmented.

0.2 (9 January 2017) ~

0.1 (30 March 2016) ~
