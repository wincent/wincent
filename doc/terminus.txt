INTRO                                                          *terminus-intro*

    "terminus (noun, pl. termini or terminuses)
    the end of a railroad or other transportation route, or a station at such
    a point; a terminal."

                                                            *terminus-features*
Terminus enhances Vim's integration with the terminal in four ways,
particularly when using tmux (https://tmux.github.io/) and iTerm
(https://www.iterm2.com/) or KDE Konsole (https://konsole.kde.org/), closing
the gap between terminal and GUI Vim:

1. Cursor shape change in insert and replace mode ~

In insert mode, the cursor shape changes to a thin vertical bar. In replace
mode, it changes to an underline. On returning to normal mode, it reverts to
the standard "block" shape. Configuration options are provided to select among
the different shapes.

2. Improved mouse support ~

Activates 'mouse' support in all modes and additionally tries to activate
|sgr-mouse| support, which allows the mouse to work "even in columns beyond
223".

3. Focus reporting ~

Allows Vim to receive |FocusGained| and |FocusLost| events, even in the
terminal and inside tmux. This is in turn used to fire the |:checktime|
command, which, in conjunction with the 'autoread', allows Vim to
automatically pick up changes made by other processes when switching to and
from Vim.

4. "Bracketed Paste" mode ~

Sets up "Bracketed Paste" mode, which means you can forget about manually
setting the 'paste' option and simply go ahead and paste in any mode.


REQUIREMENTS                                            *terminus-requirements*

Terminus was principally developed to enhance Vim's integration with iTerm,
but it can also improve the experience on other terminals, albeit with some
limitations:

- iTerm (https://www.iterm2.com/): Fully supported.
- Konsole (https://konsole.kde.org/): Supports iTerm escape sequences, so
  Terminus treats it just like iTerm.
- gnome-terminal (https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal) and other terminals
  using the VTE library (https://github.com/GNOME/vte): Partially supported
  (for example, supports cursor shape changes but not focus reporting).

For other known limitations and problems, see |terminus-troubleshooting|.


INSTALLATION                                            *terminus-installation*

To install Terminus, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice", I recommend
Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and that
you want to install Terminus into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with: >

  git clone https://github.com/wincent/terminus.git ~/.vim/bundle/terminus

Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject: >

  git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/terminus.git ~/vim/bundle/terminus
  git submodule init

To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with: >

  :call pathogen#helptags()


OPTIONS                                                      *terminus-options*

                                                        *g:TerminusCursorShape*
  |g:TerminusCursorShape|                                  boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether cursor shape changes are made when entering or leaving
  insert and replace modes. To disable, set to 0: >

    let g:TerminusCursorShape=0
<
                                                  *g:TerminusInsertCursorShape*
  |g:TerminusInsertCursorShape|                             number (default: 1)

  Controls the shape of the cursor in insert mode. Possible values are:

  - 0: "block" shape
  - 1: "bar" shape
  - 2: "underline" shape

  To override the default, set a new value in your |.vimrc|: >

    let g:TerminusInsertCursorShape=0
<
  The value set here is passed directly through to iTerm (and Konsole), so if
  future versions of those terminals start to support other possible shapes,
  Terminus will support those automatically. (And conversely, if you supply an
  invalid value, the terminal may have undefined behavior.)

  Note: has no effect if cursor shape changing is disabled via the
  |g:TerminusCursorShape| setting.

                                                  *g:TerminusNormalCursorShape*
  |g:TerminusNormalCursorShape|                             number (default: 0)

  Controls the shape of the cursor in normal mode. Possible values are:

  - 0: "block" shape
  - 1: "bar" shape
  - 2: "underline" shape

  To override the default, set a new value in your |.vimrc|: >

    let g:TerminusNormalCursorShape=2
<
  The value set here is passed directly through to iTerm (and Konsole), so if
  future versions of those terminals start to support other possible shapes,
  Terminus will support those automatically. (And conversely, if you supply an
  invalid value, the terminal may have undefined behavior.)

  Note: has no effect if cursor shape changing is disabled via the
  |g:TerminusCursorShape| setting.

                                                 *g:TerminusReplaceCursorShape*
  |g:TerminusReplaceCursorShape|                            number (default: 2)

  Controls the shape of the cursor in replace mode. Possible values are:

  - 0: "block" shape
  - 1: "bar" shape
  - 2: "underline" shape

  To override the default, set a new value in your |.vimrc|: >

    let g:TerminusReplaceCursorShape=1
<
  The value set here is passed directly through to iTerm (and Konsole), so if
  future versions of those terminals start to support other possible shapes,
  Terminus will support those automatically. (And conversely, if you supply an
  invalid value, the terminal may have undefined behavior.)

  Note: has no effect if cursor shape changing is disabled via the
  |g:TerminusCursorShape| setting.

                                                              *g:TerminusMouse*
  |g:TerminusMouse|                                         boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether Terminus attempts to improve mouse function by setting the
  'mouse' and 'ttymouse' settings. To disable this action, set to 0: >

    let g:TerminusMouse=0
<
                                                     *g:TerminusFocusReporting*
  |g:TerminusFocusReporting|                               boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether Terminus attempts to enable focus reporting and therefore
  |FocusGained| and |FocusLost| events, which then trigger the |:checktime|
  command and allow changed files to be refreshed automatically via
  'autoread'. To disable this feature, set to 0: >

    let g:TerminusFocusReporting=0
<
                                                     *g:TerminusBracketedPaste*
  |g:TerminusBracketedPaste|                               boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether Terminus attempts to set-up Bracketed Paste mode. To
  disable, set to 0: >

    let g:TerminusBracketedPaste=0
<
                                                        *terminus-assume-iterm*
                                                        *g:TerminusAssumeITerm*
  |g:TerminusAssumeITerm|                                      any (no default)

  Terminus will try to autodetect when Vim is running inside of iTerm or an
  iTerm-like terminal such as Konsole, but it is possible that when running on
  a remote host via SSH the necessary environment variables (`$ITERM_PROFILE`,
  `$ITERM_SESSION_ID`, `$KONSOLE_DBUS_SESSION` or `$KONSOLE_PROFILE_NAME`) may
  not be present.

  In this case, it is possible to signal to Terminus that iTerm is operative by
  doing either of the following:

  - Touching (ie. creating) a file at `~/.vim/.assume-iterm`.
  - Setting |g:TerminusAssumeITerm| to any value

                                                             *g:TerminusLoaded*
  |g:TerminusLoaded|                                           any (no default)

  To prevent Terminus from being loaded, set |g:TerminusLoaded| to any value
  in your |.vimrc|. For example: >

    let g:TerminusLoaded=1
<

OVERRIDES                                                  *terminus-overrides*

Terminus sets some Vim settings to reasonable defaults in order to provide a
good "out of the box" experience:

                                                            *terminus-autoread*
  'autoread'

  Turned on (if a file change made outside of Vim is detected as the result of
  running the |:checktime| command, reloads the file).

                                                         *terminus-ttimeoutlen*
  'ttimeoutlen'

  Reduced to 10 (milliseconds) to speed up the response of some mappings (for
  example, |O|) in the terminal. If the effective 'ttimeoutlen' is already 10
  or lower, Terminus leaves this setting untouched.

To override any of these choices, you can place overrides in an
|after-directory| (ie. `~/.vim/after/plugin/terminus.vim`). For example: >

  " Override Terminus' 'autoread' setting.
  set noautoread


TROUBLESHOOTING                                      *terminus-troubleshooting*

Some features work in iTerm but not in Apple's Terminal.app ~

The following features are known to work in iTerm but may not work in Apple's
Terminal.app due to limitations in the latter:

- Cursor shape changes.
- |FocusGained| and |FocusLost| events.
- Improved mouse support.

Upgrading to iTerm is strongly recommended.

Focus events aren't working inside tmux prior to 1.8 ~

tmux only added support for per-pane focus events in version 1.8.

Focus events aren't working inside tmux 1.9 and up ~

In tmux 1.9, focus events aren't reported unless the `focus-events` option is
set to "on" in the `~/.tmux.conf` file: >

  set -g focus-events on

There is a delay on leaving insert mode inside tmux ~

You may need to set `escape-time` to 0 in your `~/.tmux.conf` file: >

  set -s escape-time 0

Mouse support and other features aren't working in tmux ~

In the iTerm settings, ensure that "Enable mouse reporting" is enabled, and
the "Report Terminal Type" setting is set to "xterm-256color".

Cursor shape changes and other features aren't working on remote hosts ~

If you are connecting to remote hosts via Mosh (https://mosh.mit.edu/) instead
of SSH, be aware that Mosh lacks support for some xterm control sequences and
cannot change the cursor (https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues/352).

I can't copy text to the clipboard ~

In the iTerm settings, ensure that "Copy to pasteboard on selection" is
disabled (under "Selection" in the "General" section of the preferences), then
hold down the Option key when making a selection, then press Command-C to
copy.

For seamless integration between the local system clipboard and terminal-based
processes (even processes running on remote systems via SSH, inside tmux,
inside Vim etc), consider using Clipper (https://github.com/wincent/clipper),
along with the vim-clipper plug-in (https://github.com/wincent/vim-clipper).

The cursor is hard to see in insert mode ~

In insert mode, the cursor becomes a narrow bar, which may be hard to see
depending on your color scheme and other settings.

Reducing visual clutter may be helpful in this case. For example, you might
turn off 'cursorline' and 'cursorcolumn' when in insert mode (sample
configuration from my dotfiles: https://wincent.dev/g). Alternatively, you can
try a different cursor shapes by changing the |g:TerminusInsertCursorShape| and
|g:TerminusNormalCursorShape| settings.


FAQ                                                              *terminus-faq*

Does Terminus work with Neovim? ~

Yes, although Terminus has to do much less work in Neovim because Neovim
has better terminal integration out of the box. Specifically, Terminus
doesn't need to set up cursor shape changes, bracketed paste mode, or improved
mouse support in Neovim, but it does set up |:checktime| and |'autoread'| to make
focus reporting more useful.
