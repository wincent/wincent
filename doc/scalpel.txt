INTRO                                                            *scalpel-intro*

Scalpel provides a streamlined shortcut for replacing all instances of the
word currently under the cursor throughout a file.

In normal mode pressing `<Leader>e` (mnemonic: "edit") will display a prompt
pre-populated with the current word and with the cursor placed so that you
can start typing the desired replacement:
>
    :Scalpel/\v<foo>//
<
Press `<Enter>` and Scalpel will prompt to confirm each substitution, starting
at the current word (unlike a normal `:%s` command, which starts at the top of
the file).

Scalpel works similarly in visual mode, except that it scopes itself to the
current visual selection rather than operating over the entire file.

Screencasts that show Scalpel in action:

- https://youtu.be/YwMgnmZNWXA: "Vim screencast #13: Multiple Cursors"
- https://youtu.be/7Bx_mLDBtRc: "Vim screencast #14: *Ncgn"
- https://youtu.be/iNVyCPPYFzc: "Vim screencast #21: Scalpel update"

Note that `:Scalpel` just calls through to an underlying `scalpel#substitute`
function that does the real work, ultimately calling Vim's own `:substitute`.
As such, be aware that whatever changes you make to the command-line prior
to pressing `<Enter>` must keep it a valid pattern, or bad things will happen.

The mapping can be suppressed by setting:
>
    let g:ScalpelMap=0
<
Or overridden:
>
    " Use <Leader>s instead of default <Leader>e:
    nmap <Leader>s <Plug>(Scalpel)
<
In any case, Scalpel won't overwrite any pre-existing mapping that you might
have defined for `<Leader>e`, nor will it create an unnecessary redundant
mapping if you've already mapped something to `<Plug>(Scalpel)`.

The `:Scalpel` command name can be overridden if desired. For example, you
could shorten it to `:S` with:
>
    let g:ScalpelCommand='S'
<
Then your Scalpel prompt would look like:
>
    :S/\v<foo>//
<
The command can be entirely suppressed by setting `g:ScalpelCommand` to an
empty string:
>
    let g:ScalpelCommand=''
<
Finally, all plug-in functionality can be deactivated by setting:
>
    let g:ScalpelLoaded=1
<
in your `~/.vimrc`.

INSTALLATION                                              *scalpel-installation*

To install Scalpel, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice" and your version
of Vim has `packages` support (ie. `+packages` appears in the output of
`:version`) then you can simply place the plugin at a location under your
`'packpath'` (eg. `~/.vim/pack/bundle/start/scalpel` or similar).

For older versions of Vim, I recommend
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and
that you want to install Scalpel into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with:
>
    git clone https://github.com/wincent/scalpel.git ~/.vim/bundle/scalpel
<
Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject:
>
    git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/scalpel.git ~/vim/bundle/scalpel
    git submodule init
<
To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with:
>
    :call pathogen#helptags()
<
FAQ                                                                *scalpel-faq*

Why use Scalpel rather than a built-in alternative? ~

Scalpel is a lightweight plug-in that provides subtle but valuable
improvements to the experience you'd get by using Vim's built-in
functionality.

Compared to writing a |:substitute| command manually:

- Scalpel is quickly activated by a mapping.
- Scalpel prepopulates the search pattern with the word currently under the
  cursor.
- Scalpel avoids a jarring jump to the top of the file, instead starting
  replacements at the current location.

Compared to a mapping such as "*Ncgn":

- Scalpel allows you to preview the location at which each change will occur
  instead of performing the change blindly.
