INTRODUCTION                                    *lion*

This plugin provides operators for aligning text to a specific character.
The operators are designed to work as closely as possible to the built-in
Vim |operators|.

MAPPINGS                                        *lion-mappings*

In the mappings below, if {char} is "/", a prompt will input a pattern to use
for alignment. If the pattern is left blank, "/" will be used.

                                                *gl* *lion-right-align*
[count]gl{motion}{char} Align text within {motion} to [count] occurrences
                        of {char}. Spaces are added to the left of each
                        {char} in the line up to the [count]th position in
                        the line.
                        If no [count] is specified, align all occurrences.

                                                *gL* *lion-left-align*
[count]gL{motion}{char} Align text within {motion} to [count] occurrences
                        of {char}. Spaces are added to the right of each
                        {char} in the line up to the [count]th position in
                        the line.
                        If no [count] is specified, align all occurrences.

EXAMPLES                                        *lion-examples*

In the below examples, an asterisk (*) denotes the position of cursor. This
is primarily to help understand {motion}s from the example commands.

  Old text                  Command     New text ~

  $name = "Tom";            glip=       $name     = "Tom";
  $birthday =* "Jan 12";                $birthday = "Jan 12";
  $age = 25;                            $age      = 25;

  fish, monkey, giraffe*    2gL3j,      fish,    monkey,   giraffe
  a, b, c                               a,       b,        c
