# Violentmonkey

Provides a mechanism for managing Violentmonkey "userscripts" on macOS that is:

- Versioned (ie. in this Git repo); and:
- Isolated from the broader network (ie. instead of auto-updating userscripts downloaded from the internet, or trusting the extension with access to the local filesystem, scripts are served over the built-in Apache webserver).

For a discussion of the trade-offs, see these related commit messages:

Once the Violentmonkey extension is installed, installing the scripts is a matter of visiting the corresponding URLs (see [index.html](templates/UserScripts/index.html), which gets templated to `~/Sites/UserScripts/index.html`) and clicking the "Install" button.
