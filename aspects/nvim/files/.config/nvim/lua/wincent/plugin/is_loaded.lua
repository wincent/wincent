--- Checks to see whether `plugin` is in the `'runtimepath'` ie. whether the
--- call to `wincent.plugin.load()` (and therefore `:packadd`) is present and
--- uncommented in the `init.lua` startup file.

--- For Lua plugins, we would generally do the idiomatic thing with `pcall()`
--- instead:
---
---    local has_cmp, cmp = pcall(require, 'cmp')
---    if has_cmp then
---      -- Use `cmp` here...
---    end
---
--- But for Vimscript plugins, `pcall()` is of no use, so we have this function
--- instead.
---
--- @param plugin string The plugin name to be checked.
