INTRODUCTION                                                        *easydir*

Using easydir is quite easy. Functionality remains the same for editing and
saving files, but now you can prepend nonexistent directories to the desired
file name to create them both.

EXAMPLES

:e new_directory/new_file.txt      Edits a file called |new_file.txt|
                                   which is nested inside |new_directory|

:sp new_directory/new_file2.txt    Split a new window assign the file
                                   as |new_file2.txt| and
                                   create the directory |new_directory|

:n new_dir/another_dir/file.txt    You can even nest multiple directories!

That's it! So *easy!*
