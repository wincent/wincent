GIT COMMIT                                              *ft-gitcommit-plugin*

One command, :DiffGitCached, is provided to show a diff of the current commit
in the preview window.  It is equivalent to calling "git diff --cached" plus
any arguments given to the command.

GIT REBASE                                              *ft-gitrebase-plugin*

In a gitrebase filetype buffer, the following commands are provided:

  `:Pick`     Changes the cursor line to a `pick` line.
  `:Squash`   Changes the cursor line to a `squash` line
  `:Edit`     Changes the cursor line to an `edit` line
  `:Reword`   Changes the cursor line to a `reword` line
  `:Fixup`    Changes the cursor line to a `fixup` line
  `:Drop`     Changes the cursor line to a `drop` line
  `:Cycle`    Cycles between the first 5 gitrebase commands

To make the `:Cycle` command more useful, it might be mapped, e.g. >
  nnoremap <buffer> <silent> S :Cycle<CR>
<
