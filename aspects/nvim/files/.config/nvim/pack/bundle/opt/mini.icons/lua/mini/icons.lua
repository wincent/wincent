--- *mini.icons* Icon provider
---
--- MIT License Copyright (c) 2024 Evgeni Chasnovski

--- Features:
---
--- - Provide icons with their highlighting via a single |MiniIcons.get()| for
---   various categories: filetype, file/directory path, extension, operating
---   system, LSP kind values. Icons and category defaults can be overridden.
---
--- - Configurable styles: "glyph" (icon glyphs) or "ascii" (non-glyph fallback).
---
--- - Fixed set of highlight groups (linked to built-in groups by default) for
---   better blend with color scheme.
---
--- - Caching for maximum performance.
---
--- - Integration with |vim.filetype.add()| and |vim.filetype.match()|.
---
--- - Mocking methods of 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' for better integrations
---   with plugins outside 'mini.nvim'. See |MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()|.
---
--- - Tweaking built-in maps for "LSP kind" to include icons. In particular, this
---   makes |mini.completion| use icons in LSP step. See |MiniIcons.tweak_lsp_kind()|.
---
--- Notes:
---
--- - It is not a goal to become a collection of icons for as much use cases as
---   possible. There are specific criteria for icon data to be included as
---   built-in in each category (see |MiniIcons.get()|).
---   The main supported category is "filetype".
---
--- Recommendations for plugin authors using 'mini.icons' as a dependency:
---
--- - Check if `_G.MiniIcons` table is present (which means that user explicitly
---   enabled 'mini.icons') and provide icons only if it is.
---
--- - Use |MiniIcons.get()| function to get icon string and more data about it.
---
--- - For file icons prefer using full path instead of relative or only basename.
---   It makes a difference if path matches pattern that uses parent directories.
---   The |MiniIcons.config| has an example of that.
---
--- # Dependencies ~
---
--- Suggested dependencies:
---
--- - Terminal emulator that supports showing special utf8 glyphs, possibly with
---   "overflow" view (displaying is done not in one but two visual cells).
---   Most modern feature-rich terminal emulators support this out of the box:
---   WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty, iTerm2, Ghostty.
---   Not having "overflow" feature only results into smaller icons.
---   Not having support for special utf8 glyphs will result into seemingly
---   random symbols (or question mark squares) instead of icon glyphs.
---
--- - Font that supports Nerd Fonts (https://www.nerdfonts.com) icons from
---   version 3.0.0+ (in particular `nf-md-*` class).
---   This should be configured on terminal emulator level either by using font
---   patched with Nerd Fonts icons or using `NerdFontsSymbolsOnly` font as
---   a fallback for glyphs that are not supported in main font.
---
--- If using terminal emulator and/or font with icon support is impossible, use
--- `config.style = 'ascii'`. It will use a (less visually appealing) set of
--- non-glyph icons.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.icons').setup({})` (replace `{}`
--- with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniIcons` which you
--- can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniIcons.*`).
---
--- See |MiniIcons.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - [nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) (for users):
---     - Sets individual colors to each icon with separate specific highlight
---       groups, while this modules uses fixed set of highlight groups.
---       This makes it easier to customize in bulk and actually blend with any
---       color scheme.
---
---     - This module prefers richer set of `nf-md-*` (from "Material design" set)
---       Nerd Fonts icons while 'nvim-web-devicons' mostly prefers `nf-dev-*`
---       (from "devicons" set).
---
---     - Supported categories are slightly different (with much overlap).
---
---     - Both support customization of any icon. Only this module supports
---       customization of default ones per supported category.
---
---     - Using this module can occasionally result in small delays when used
---       synchronously for many times to get icons for not typical files (like
---       in |mini.files|). This is due to using |vim.filetype.match()| fallback and
---       is present only during first call, as value is cached for later uses.
---
---     - This module supports different icon styles (like "ascii" for when using
---       glyphs is not possible), while 'nvim-web-devicons' does not.
---
---     - This module provides |MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()| function which
---       when called imitates installed 'nvim-web-devicons' plugin to support
---       other plugins which do not provide 'mini.icons' yet.
---
--- - [nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) (for plugin developers):
---     - Both have main "get icon" type of function:
---         - Both return tuple of icon and highlight group strings.
---
---         - This module always returns icon data possibly falling back to
---           user's configured default, while 'nvim-web-devicons' is able to
---           return `nil`. This module's approach is more aligned with the most
---           common use case of always showing an icon instead or near some data.
---           There is a third returned value indicating if output is a result of
---           a fallback (see |MiniIcons.get()|).
---
---         - This module uses |vim.filetype.match()| as a fallback for "file"
---           and "extension" categories, while 'nvim-web-devicons' completely
---           relies on the manually maintained tables of supported filenames
---           and extensions.
---           Using fallback results in a wider support and deeper integration
---           with Neovim's filetype detection at the cost of occasional slower
---           first call. The difference is reduced as much as is reasonable by
---           preferring faster file extension resolution over filetype matching.
---
---         - This module caches all its return values resulting in really fast
---           next same argument calls, while 'nvim-web-devicons' doesn't do that.
---
---         - This module works with full file/directory paths as input.
---
---     - Different sets of supported categories (see |MiniIcons.config|):
---         - Both support "file", "extension", "filetype", "operating system".
---           Albeit in different volumes: 'nvim-web-devicons' covers more
---           cases for "operating system", while this module has better eventual
---           coverage for other cases.
---
---         - This module supports "directory" and "lsp" categories.
---
---         - 'nvim-web-devicons' covers "desktop environment" and "window
---           management" categories. This modules does not include them due to
---           relatively low demand.
---
--- - [onsails/lspkind.nvim](https://github.com/onsails/lspkind.nvim):
---     - Provides icons only for `CompletionItemKind`, while this module also has
---       icons for `SymbolKind` and other non-LSP categories.
---     - Provides dedicated formatting function for 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp' while this
---       module intentionally does not (adding icons should be straightforward
---       to manually implement while anything else is out of scope).
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- Only the following set of highlight groups is used as icon highlight.
--- It is recommended that they all only define colored foreground:
---
--- - `MiniIconsAzure`  - azure.
--- - `MiniIconsBlue`   - blue.
--- - `MiniIconsCyan`   - cyan.
--- - `MiniIconsGreen`  - green.
--- - `MiniIconsGrey`   - grey.
--- - `MiniIconsOrange` - orange.
--- - `MiniIconsPurple` - purple.
--- - `MiniIconsRed`    - red.
--- - `MiniIconsYellow` - yellow.
---
--- To change any highlight group, set it directly with |nvim_set_hl()|.

--- Defaults ~
---@eval return MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code(MiniDoc.current.eval_section)
---@text # Style ~
---
--- `config.style` is a string defining which icon style to use. It can be:
--- - `'glyph'` (default) - use glyph icons (like 󰈔 and 󰉋 ).
--- - `'ascii'` - use fallback ASCII-compatible icons. Those are computed as
---   an upper first character of the icon's resolved name inside its category.
---   Examples: >lua
---
---     MiniIcons.get('file', 'Makefile') -- Has `'M'` as icon
---     MiniIcons.get('extension', 'lua') -- Has `'L'` as icon
---     MiniIcons.get('file', 'file.lua') -- Has `'L'` as icon; it is resolved to
---                                       -- come from 'lua' 'extension' category
---     MiniIcons.get('file', 'myfile')   -- Has `'F'` as icon; it is resolved to
---                                       -- come from 'file' 'default' category
--- <
--- # Customization per category ~
---
--- The following entries can be used to customize icons for supported categories:
--- - `config.default`
--- - `config.directory`
--- - `config.extension`
--- - `config.file`
--- - `config.filetype`
--- - `config.lsp`
--- - `config.os`
---
--- Customization should be done by supplying a table with <glyph> (icon glyph)
--- and/or <hl> (name of highlight group) string fields as a value for an icon
--- name entry. Example: >lua
---
---   require('mini.icons').setup({
---     default = {
---       -- Override default glyph for "file" category (reuse highlight group)
---       file = { glyph = '󰈤' },
---     },
---     extension = {
---       -- Override highlight group (not necessary from 'mini.icons')
---       lua = { hl = 'Special' },
---
---       -- Add icons for custom extension. This will also be used in
---       -- 'file' category for input like 'file.my.ext'.
---       ['my.ext'] = { glyph = '󰻲', hl = 'MiniIconsRed' },
---     },
---   })
--- <
--- Notes:
--- - These customizations only take effect inside |MiniIcons.setup()| call.
---   Changing interactively via `:lua MiniIcons.config.xxx = { ... }` does not work
---   for performance reasons.
--- - Use lower case names for categories which are matched ignoring case.
---   See |MiniIcons.get()| for more details.
---
--- # Using extension during file resolution ~
---
--- `config.use_file_extension` is a function which can be used to control which
--- extensions will be considered as a source of icon data during "file" category
--- resolution (see |MiniIcons.get()| for more details).
--- Default: function which always returns `true` (i.e. consider all extensions).
---
--- Will be called once for the biggest suffix after dot found in the file name.
--- The arguments will be `ext` (found extension; lowercase) and `file` (input for
--- which icon is computed; as is). Should explicitly return `true` if `ext` is to
--- be considered (i.e. call `MiniIcons.get('extension', ext)` and use its
--- output if it is not default). Otherwise extension won't be even considered.
---
--- The primary use case for this setting is to ensure that some extensions are
--- ignored in order for resolution to reach |vim.filetype.match()| stage. This
--- is needed if there is a set up filetype detection for files with recognizable
--- extension and conflicting icons (which you want to use). Note: if problematic
--- filetype detection involves only known in advance file names, prefer using
--- `config.file` customization.
---
--- Example: >lua
---
---   -- Built-in filetype detection recognizes files like "queries/.*%.scm"
---   -- as "query" filetype. However, without special setup, 'mini.icons' will
---   -- use "scm" extension to resolve as Scheme file. Here is a setup to ignore
---   -- "scm" extension and completely rely on `vim.filetype.match()` fallback.
---   require('mini.icons').setup({
---     -- Check last letters explicitly to account for dots in file name
---     use_file_extension = function(ext) return ext:sub(-3) ~= 'scm' end
---   })
---
---   -- Another common choices for extensions to ignore: "yml", "json", "txt".
--- <
MiniIcons.config = {
  -- Icon style: 'glyph' or 'ascii'
  style = 'glyph',

  -- Customize per category. See `:h MiniIcons.config` for details.
  default   = {},
  directory = {},
  extension = {},
  file      = {},
  filetype  = {},
  lsp       = {},
  os        = {},

  -- Control which extensions will be considered during "file" resolution
  use_file_extension = function(ext, file) return true end,
}

--- Get icon data
---
--- Usage example: >lua
---
---   -- Results into `icon='󰢱'`, `hl='MiniIconsAzure'`, `is_default=false`
---   local icon, hl, is_default = MiniIcons.get('file', 'file.lua')
--- <
--- Notes:
--- - Always returns some data, even if icon name is not explicitly supported
---   within target category. Category "default" is used as a fallback. Use third
---   output value to check if this particular case is a result of a fallback.
---
--- - Glyphs are explicitly preferred (when reasonable) from a richer set of
---   `nf-md-*` class  ("Material design" set) of Nerd Fonts icons.
---
--- - Output is cached after the first call to increase performance of next calls
---   with same arguments. To reset cache, call |MiniIcons.setup()|.
---
--- - To increase first call performance for "extension" and "file" categories,
---   add frequently used values in |MiniIcons.config|. They will be preferred
---   over executing |vim.filetype.match()|.
---
--- - Matching icon name for "file" and "directory" categories is done exactly
---   and respecting case. Others are done ignoring case.
---
---@param category string Category name. Supported categories:
---   - `'default'` - icon data used as fallback for any category.
---     Icon names:
---       - <Input>: any supported category name.
---       - <Built-in>: only supported category names.
---
---     Examples: >lua
---
---       MiniIcons.get('default', 'file')
--- <
---   - `'directory'` - icon data for directory path.
---     Icon names:
---       - <Input>: any string, but only basename is used. Works with not present
---         paths (no check is done).
---       - <Built-in>: popular directory names not tied to language/software
---         (with few notable exceptions like Neovim, Git, etc.).
---
---     Examples: >lua
---
---       -- All of these will result in the same output
---       MiniIcons.get('directory', '.config')
---       MiniIcons.get('directory', '~/.config')
---       MiniIcons.get('directory', '/home/user/.config')
---
---       -- Results in different output
---       MiniIcons.get('directory', '.Config')
--- <
---   - `'extension'` - icon data for extension.
---     Icon names:
---       - <Input>: any string (without extra dot prefix).
---       - <Built-in>: popular extensions without associated filetype plus a set
---         for which filetype detection gives not good enough result.
---
---     Icon data is attempted to be resolved in the following order:
---       - List of user configured and built-in extensions (for better results).
---         Run `:=MiniIcons.list('extension')` to see them.
---         Used also if present as suffix after the dot (widest one preferred).
---       - Filetype as a result of |vim.filetype.match()| with placeholder
---         file name. Uses icon data from "filetype" category.
---
---     Examples: >lua
---
---       -- All of these will result in the same output
---       MiniIcons.get('extension', 'lua')
---       MiniIcons.get('extension', 'LUA')
---       MiniIcons.get('extension', 'my.lua')
--- <
---   - `'file'` - icon data for file path.
---     Icon names:
---       - <Input>: any string. Works with not present paths (no check is done).
---       - <Built-in>: popular file names not tied to language/software
---         (with few notable exceptions like Neovim, Git, etc.) plus a set which
---         has recognizable extension but has special detectable filetype.
---
---     Icon data is attempted to be resolved in the following order:
---       - List of user configured and built-in file names (matched to basename
---         of the input exactly). Run `:=MiniIcons.list('file')` to see them.
---       - Basename extension:
---           - Matched directly as `get('extension', ext)`, where `ext` is the
---             widest suffix after the dot.
---           - Considered only if `config.use_file_extension` returned `true`.
---           - Only recognizable extensions (i.e. not default fallback) are used.
---       - Filetype as a result of |vim.filetype.match()| with full input (not
---         basename) as `filename`. Uses icon data from "filetype" category.
---
---     Examples: >lua
---
---       -- All of these will result in the same output
---       MiniIcons.get('file', 'init.lua')
---       MiniIcons.get('file', '~/.config/nvim/init.lua')
---       MiniIcons.get('file', '/home/user/.config/nvim/init.lua')
---
---       -- Results in different output
---       MiniIcons.get('file', 'Init.lua')
---       MiniIcons.get('file', 'init.LUA')
---
---       -- Respects full path input in `vim.filetype.match()`
---       MiniIcons.get('file', '.git/info/attributes')
--- <
---   - `'filetype'` - icon data for 'filetype' values.
---     Icon names:
---       - <Input>: any string.
---       - <Built-in>: any filetype that is reasonably used in Neovim ecosystem.
---         This category is intended as a widest net for supporting use cases.
---         Users are encouraged to have a specific filetype detection set up.
---
---     Examples: >lua
---
---       MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'lua')
---       MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'help')
---       MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'minifiles')
--- <
---   - `'lsp'` - icon data for various "LSP kind" values.
---     Icon names:
---       - <Input>: any string.
---       - <Built-in>: only namesspace entries from LSP specification that are
---         can be displayed to user. Like `CompletionItemKind`, `SymbolKind`, etc.
---
---     Examples: >lua
---
---       MiniIcons.get('lsp', 'array')
---       MiniIcons.get('lsp', 'keyword')
--- <
---   - `'os'` - icon data for popular operating systems.
---     Icon names:
---       - <Input>: any string.
---       - <Built-in>: only operating systems which have `nf-md-*` class icon.
---
---     Examples: >lua
---
---       MiniIcons.get('os', 'linux')
---       MiniIcons.get('os', 'arch')
---       MiniIcons.get('os', 'macos')
--- <

--- Tweak built-in LSP kind names
---
--- Update in place appropriate maps in |vim.lsp.protocol| (`CompletionItemKind`
--- and `SymbolKind`) by using icon strings from "lsp" category. Only "numeric
--- id to kind name" part is updated (to preserve data from original map).
---
--- Updating is done in one of these modes:
--- - Append:  add icon after text.
--- - Prepend: add icon before text (default).
--- - Replace: use icon instead of text.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Makes |mini.completion| show icons, as it uses built-in protocol map.
--- - Results in loading whole `vim.lsp` module, so might add significant amount
---   of time on startup. Call it lazily. For example, with |MiniDeps.later()|: >lua
---
---     require('mini.icons').setup()
---     MiniDeps.later(MiniIcons.tweak_lsp_kind)
--- <
---@param mode string|nil One of "prepend" (default), "append", "replace".

-- Track filetypes that are newly added to Neovim core by looking at changes of
-- 'runtime/lua/vim/filetype.lua' and 'runtime/lua/vim/filetype/detect.lua'.
-- Latest date of sync: 2026-02-13.
-- Rough process of how glyphs and icons are chosen:
-- - Try to balance usage of highlight groups.
-- - Prefer using the following Nerd Fonts classes (from best to worst):
--     - `nf-md-*` (UTF codes seem to be more thought through). It also has
--       correct double width in Kitty.
--     - `nf-dev-*` (more supported devicons).
--     - `nf-seti-*` (more up to date extensions).
--     - `nf-custom-*` (niche Nerd Fonts only glyphs).
-- - If filetype is present in 'nvim-web-devicons', use highlight group with
--   most similar hue (based on OKLCH color space with equally spaced grid as
--   in 'mini.hues' and chroma=3 for grey cutoff; adjust manually if needed).
-- - Sets that have same/close glyphs but maybe different highlights:
--     - Generic configuration filetypes (".*conf.*", ".*rc", if stated in
--       filetype file description, etc.) have same glyph.
--     - Similar language: assembly ("asm"), SQL, Perl, HTML, CSV, shell.
--     - Log files.
--     - Make / build system.
--     - Related to Internet/Web.
-- - For newly assigned icons use semantically close (first by filetype origin,
--   then by name) abstract icons with `nf-md-*` Nerd Fonts class.
-- - If no semantically close abstract icon present, use plain letter/digit
--   icon (based on the first filetype character) with highlight groups picked
--   randomly to achieve overall balance (trying to minimize maximum number of
--   glyph-hl duplicates).
