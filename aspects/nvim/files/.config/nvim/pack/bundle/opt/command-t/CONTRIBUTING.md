# Contributing

Patches are welcome via the usual mechanisms (pull requests, email, posting to the project issue tracker etc).

For more details, see the "command-t-development" section in [the documentation](https://github.com/wincent/command-t/blob/main/doc/command-t.txt).

# Releasing

1. Update "command-t-history" section in `doc/command-t.txt`.
2. Edit metadata in `lua/wincent/commandt/version.lua` to reflect new `$VERSION`.
3. Commit using `git commit -p -m "chore: prepare for $VERSION release"`.
4. Create tag with `git tag -s $VERSION -m "$VERSION release"`.
5. Fast-forward the `release` branch to match the tag.
6. Check release readiness with `make check`.
7. Produce ZIP archive with `bin/create-archive`.
8. Upload new release to [vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025).
9. Push with `git push --follow-tags`.
10. Update [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/wincent/command-t/releases).
11. Start a new entry under "command-t-history" in `doc/command-t.txt` for subsequent development.
12. Edit metadata in `lua/wincent/comamndt/version.lua` to show `prelease = 'main'` and `version = 'x.y.z-main`.

# Reproducing bugs

Sometimes [user bug reports](https://github.com/wincent/command-t/issues) depend on characteristics of their local setup. Reproducing this may require copying configuration and installing dependencies, something I'd rather not do to my own development system. So, here are some notes about setting up Vagrant on macOS to provide a disposable VM on which to try things out in a controlled environment.

## Installing Vagrant and VirtualBox

```bash
brew install vagrant
brew install --cask virtualbox
```

## Creating a Vagrant VM

```bash
vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64 # First time only; creates Vagrantfile.
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

### Trouble-shooting Vagrant issues

There are lots of things that can go wrong, so here are a few links:

- ["There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51356705/2103996).
- ["Vagrant up error while executing â€˜VBoxManageâ€™"](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/vagrant-up-error-while-executing-vboxmanage/16825).

Which, among other things suggest these possible fixes:

```bash
sudo "/Library/Application Support/VirtualBox/LaunchDaemons/VirtualBoxStartup.sh" restart
vagrant destroy -f
vagrant box remove hashicorp/bionic64
rm ~/Library/VirtualBox
```

For me, removing `~/Library/VirtualBox` did the trick.

## Setting up Neovim on the VM

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y neovim # It's v0.2.2 ðŸ¤¦ â€” not going to be much help, so...

sudo apt-get install -y cmake gettext libtool libtool-bin pkg-config unzip # instead...
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
cd neovim
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
sudo make install
```

## Installing Command-T and other dependencies manually

Manual install:

```bash
BUNDLE=$HOME/.config/nvim/pack/bundle/start
mkdir -p $BUNDLE
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wincent/command-t $BUNDLE/command-t
echo "require('wincent.commandt').setup()" > ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
(cd $BUNDLE/command-t/lua/wincent/commandt/lib && make)

# Also install any other plug-ins that might be needed to reproduce a problem; eg:

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs $BUNDLE/auto-pairs
```

## Installing Command-T using Packer

For reproducing reports like [this one](https://github.com/wincent/command-t/issues/393#issuecomment-1229541720).

```bash
BUNDLE=$HOME/.config/nvim/pack/bundle/start
mkdir -p $BUNDLE
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim $BUNDLE/packer.nvim
```

Then, in `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`:

```
require('packer').startup(function(use)
  use {
    'wincent/command-t',
    run = 'cd lua/wincent/commandt/lib && make',
    config = function()
      require('wincent.commandt').setup()
    end,
  }
end)
```

and run `:PackerInstall`.

## Cleaning up after testing is done

```bash
exit
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy
```

# Profiling

In order to get intelligible stack traces, compile with debug symbols with:

```
make PROFILE=1
```

## On macOS

I didn't have any success the last time I tried `xctrace`, but including the notes here for reference anyway:

```
xctrace record --launch bin/benchmarks/matcher.lua --template "CPU Profiler" # Instruments.app hangs while opening this.
xctrace record --launch bin/benchmarks/matcher.lua --template "Time Profiler" # Instruments.app hangs while opening this.
xctrace record --launch bin/benchmarks/matcher.lua --template "Activity Monitor" # Produces not very useful system-wide stats.
xctrace record --launch bin/benchmarks/matcher.lua --template "Allocations" # Completes with an error and produces no useful info.
```

In theory, should be able to run the following, but it hangs:

```
xctrace symbolicate --input some.trace --dsym lua/wincent/commandt/lib/commandt.so.dSYM
```

I also attempted using the `/usr/bin/sample` tool, which produces results, albeit not particularly easy ones to parse:

```
(sleep 1 && luajit bin/benchmarks/matcher.lua) &
sample -wait luajit -mayDie
```

`dtrace`, however, produced a useful result, albeit with some hoop-jumping required:

```
sudo -v
luajit bin/benchmarks/matcher.lua & ; DTRACE_PID=$! ; sudo vmmap $DTRACE_PID | grep commandt.so ; sudo dtrace -x ustackframes=100 -p $DTRACE_PID -n \
  'profile-100 /pid == '$DTRACE_PID'/ { @[ustack()] = count(); }' -o dtrace.stacks
```

ie. refresh sudo credentials, kick off `luajit`, grab the base address of the `commandt`.so library so that we can symbolicate later on, run `dtrace` for 60s, sample 100 times per second (ie. every 10ms), grab user stack (not kernel frames), then exit.

I tried a few tricks[^tricks] to get `dtrace` to symbolicate for us automatically but eventually had to do it manually with `atos`. Grab the base address of the `__TEXT` segment (printed by `vmmap`); in this example, `0x104ac0000`:

```
__TEXT                      104ac0000-104ac8000    [   32K    32K     0K     0K] r-x/rwx SM=COW          /Users/USER/*/commandt.so
__DATA_CONST                104ac8000-104acc000    [   16K    16K    16K     0K] r--/rwx SM=COW          /Users/USER/*/commandt.so
__LINKEDIT                  104acc000-104ad0000    [   16K    16K     0K     0K] r--/rwx SM=COW          /Users/USER/*/commandt.so
```

Then run this hacky script:

```
cat dtrace.stacks | bin/symbolicate-dtrace 0x104ac0000 > dtrace.symbolicated
```

Which produces output that can then be visualized with:

```
git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
cd FlameGraph
./stackcollapse.pl dtrace.symbolicated > dtrace.collapsed
./flamegraph.pl dtrace.collapsed > dtrace.svg
```

[^tricks]: Tricks which didn't work included running from inside `lua/wincent/commandt/lib` (where the dSYM bundle is), and moving the dSYM bundle up to the root and running from there.

    The probable reason why automatic symbol discovery doesn't work is the UUID mismatch between the library and the process that `dtrace` is executing:

    ```
    dwarfdump --uuid lua/wincent/commandt/lib/commandt.so       # This matches...
    dwarfdump --uuid lua/wincent/commandt/lib/commandt.so.dSYM  # ... with this;
    dwarfdump --uuid /opt/homebrew/bin/luajit                   # but not with this.
    ```

I also had success straightforwardly with [Samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply):

```
cargo install --locked samply
TIMES=1 ~/.cargo/bin/samply record luajit bin/benchmarks/matcher.lua
```

**Note:** Using `TIMES=1` because otherwise the generated `profile.json` is too big and crashes Chrome (but not Safari).

### Using PGO (Profile-Guided Optimizations)

Make a build that collects profiling data:

```
make CFLAGS=-fprofile-generate
```

Run the program to generate the profiling data:

```
TIMES=1 bin/benchmarks/matcher.lua
```

Prepare the data:

```
xcrun llvm-profdata merge -output=lua/wincent/commandt/lib/default.profdata *.profraw
```

Make a build using the profiling data:

```
make CFLAGS=-fprofile-use
```
