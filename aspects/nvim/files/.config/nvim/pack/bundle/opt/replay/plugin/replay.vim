" @plugin replay Replay plug-in for Vim
"
" # Intro
"
" Replay sets up a mapping (|<CR>| by default) to execute the last recorded
" macro.
"
" Without Replay, you can execute a macro in register "q" by hitting |@|
" followed by "q", but that is relatively uncomfortable to type. Once you've
" played the macro back once, you can play it again with |@@|, which is easier
" but still not as comfortable as just hitting |<CR>|.
"
" |<CR>| is chosen because its standard behavior is not super useful (moves down
" a line, placing the cursor on the first non-blank character). You can still
" use |+| to the same effect, or an alternative like |j| which is similar but
" does not move to the first non-blank character.
"
" Replay won't do anything in "special" buffers such as |quickfix| listings or
" [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) explorers, because in
" those the |<CR>| actually does have useful navigation behavior.
"
" # Implementation
"
" I originally had this idea implemented as a simple mapping of |<CR>| to |@@|,
" but that was problematic for a couple of reasons: |@@| would only replay the
" last executed macro, which meant that on the first run it would complain with
" error |E748| that there was "No previously used register"; this behavior was
" confusing because it would still work, sometimes, based on information
" recovered from the |viminfo| file. If you're one of those who mostly records
" into the "q" register, this meant that the mapping usually worked, but not
" always, which is a pretty annoying state of affairs.
"
" As such, Replay tries to provide "last recorded" rather than "last executed"
" semantics. It does this by overriding the |q| mapping to take a snapshot of
" the current register state when recording a macro. When you hit |<CR>|, it
" figures out which register was updated and executes that one.
"
" Note that this is an imprecise art because Vim doesn't provide any hooks that
" would allow you to know for sure which is the last-modified register (for
" example if you recorded to multiple registers); Replay will detect the first
" one with updated contents.
"
" Once you've replayed a macro once with |<CR>|, you can mash it repeatedly at
" will. You can also make use of recursion (ie. hitting |<CR>| during a macro
" recording) like you would recording any other Vim macro (although note that
" |<CR>| won't do anything during recording, only during playback).
"
" If you then execute a macro from a different register (say, "w"), then hitting
" |<CR>| will repeat that macro instead of the last recorded one. This behavior
" is based on the notion that you usually want to repeat the last thing you did,
" whether that be the last thing you recorded or the last thing you executed,
" whichever happened later.
"
" Note that the heuristic here will do what you want most of the time, but it is
" not infallible. For example, you could record into register "q", then play
" back register "w", and when you hit |<CR>| Replay will execute register "q"
" rather than "w". This is due to the lack of hooks already mentioned above.
"
" As a last resort fallback, if neither a last-recorded nor last-played macro is
" detected, Replay will attempt to execute the macro in the "q" register, as
" that is a popular default register choice.
"
" # Installation
"
" To install Replay, use your plug-in management system of choice.
"
" If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice" and your version of
" Vim has `packages` support (ie. `+packages` appears in the output of
" `:version`) then you can simply place the plugin at a location under your
" `'packpath'` (eg. `~/.vim/pack/bundle/start/replay` or similar).
"
" For older versions of Vim, I recommend
" [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
" robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and that
" you want to install Replay into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with:
"
" ```
" git clone https://github.com/wincent/replay.git ~/.vim/bundle/replay
" ```
"
" Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
" the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject:
"
" ```
" git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/replay.git ~/vim/bundle/replay
" git submodule init
" ```
"
" To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with:
"
" ```
" :call pathogen#helptags()
" ```

" # Development
"
" ## Contributing patches
"
" Patches can be sent via mail to greg@hurrell.net, or as GitHub pull requests
" at: https://github.com/wincent/replay/pulls
"
" ## Cutting a new release
"
" At the moment the release process is manual:
"
" - Perform final sanity checks and manual testing.
" - Update the [replay-history](#user-content-replay-history) section of the documentation.
" - Regenerate the documentation:
"
" ```
" docvim README.md doc/replay.txt
" ```
"
" - Verify clean work tree:
"
" ```
" git status
" ```
"
" - Tag the release:
"
" ```
" git tag -s -m "$VERSION release" $VERSION
" ```
"
" - Publish the code:
"
" ```
" git push origin main --follow-tags
" git push github main --follow-tags
" ```
"
" - Produce the release archive:
"
" ```
" git archive -o replay-$VERSION.zip HEAD -- .
" ```
"
" - Upload to http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5483
