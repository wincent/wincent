# speeddating.vim

Take the following date:

    1999-12-31

Because Vim treats the hyphen as a negative sign, pressing `<C-A>` on the 31
would normally increment it to

    1999-12-30

Compare this with what happens when speeddating.vim is installed:

    2000-01-01

Pressing `5<C-X>` on the `03` in the first line below transforms it into the
second:

    Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:03 +0000
    Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:58 +0000

Several date, time, and datetime formats are included.  Additional formats can
be defined in a strftime-like syntax with the `:SpeedDatingFormat` command.

Existing Vim semantics are preserved.  `<C-A>` and `<C-X>` accept a count, and
plain number incrementing is used if no date format is matched.

Use of `<C-A>`/`<C-X>` in visual mode enables incrementing several lines at
once.  Blank spots are filled by incrementing the match from the previous
line, allowing for creation of sequences (1, 2, 3; 2000-10-30, 2000-10-31,
2000-11-01).

It can also increment roman numerals and ordinals (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...).  In
visual mode, letters of the alphabet are supported.

`d<C-X>` sets the timestamp under the cursor to the current time.  `d<C-A>`
does the same, but uses UTC rather than the local time.

The `.` command will work as expected if you install
[repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat).
