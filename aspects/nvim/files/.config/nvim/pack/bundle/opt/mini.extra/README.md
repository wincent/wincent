## Features

Extra useful functionality which is not essential enough for other 'mini.nvim' modules to include directly.

Features:

- Various pickers for ['mini.pick'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-pick.md):
    - Built-in diagnostic (`MiniExtra.pickers.diagnostic()`).
    - File explorer (`MiniExtra.pickers.explorer()`).
    - Git branches/commits/files/hunks (`MiniExtra.pickers.git_hunks()`, etc.).
    - Command/search/input history (`MiniExtra.pickers.history()`).
    - LSP references/symbols/etc. (`MiniExtra.pickers.lsp()`).
    - Tree-sitter nodes (`MiniExtra.pickers.treesitter()`).
    - **And much more**.
  See `:h MiniExtra.pickers` for more.

- Various textobject specifications for ['mini.ai'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-ai.md). See `:h MiniExtra.gen_ai_spec`.

- Various highlighters for ['mini.hipatterns'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-hipatterns.md). See `:h MiniExtra.gen_highlighter`.

Notes:

- This module requires only those 'mini.nvim' modules which are needed for a particular functionality: 'mini.pick' for pickers, etc.

For more information see these parts of help:

- `:h MiniExtra.pickers`
- `:h MiniExtra.gen_ai_spec`
- `:h MiniExtra.gen_highlighter`

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.extra').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{}
```
