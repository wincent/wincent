### tmux

[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is *not* the default, to use it you will have to add this line to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:slime_target = "tmux"
```

When you invoke `vim-slime` for the first time, you will be prompted for more configuration.

tmux socket name or absolute path:

    If you started tmux with the -L or -S flag, use that same socket name or path here.
    If you didn't put anything, the default name is "default".

tmux target pane:

Note that all of these ordinals are 0-indexed by default.

    ":"       means current window, current pane (a reasonable default)
    ":i"      means the ith window, current pane
    ":i.j"    means the ith window, jth pane
    "h:i.j"   means the tmux session where h is the session identifier
              (either session name or number), the ith window and the jth pane
    "%i"      means i refers the pane's unique id
    "{token}" one of tmux's supported special tokens, like "{last}"


You can configure the defaults for these options. If you generally run vim in
a split tmux window with a REPL in the other pane:

```vim
let g:slime_default_config = {"socket_name": get(split($TMUX, ","), 0), "target_pane": ":.2"}
```

Or, more reliably, by leveraging [a special token](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1#_last__2) as pane index:

```vim
let g:slime_default_config = {"socket_name": "default", "target_pane": "{last}"}
```

### bracketed-paste

Some REPLs can interfere with your text pasting. The [bracketed-paste](https://cirw.in/blog/bracketed-paste) mode exists to allow raw pasting.

`tmux` supports bracketed-paste, use:

```vim
let g:slime_bracketed_paste = 1
" or
let b:slime_bracketed_paste = 1
```

(It is disabled by default because it can create issues with ipython; see [#265](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime/pull/265)).
