SETUP                                           *projectionist-setup*

Projections are maps from file names and globs to sets of properties
describing the file.  The simplest way to define them is to create a
".projections.json" in the root of the project.  Here's a simple example for a
Maven project:
>
    {
      "src/main/java/*.java": {
        "alternate": "src/test/java/{}.java",
        "type": "source"
      },
      "src/test/java/*.java": {
        "alternate": "src/main/java/{}.java",
        "type": "test"
      },
      "*.java": {"dispatch": "javac {file}"},
      "*": {"make": "mvn"}
    }
<
In property values, "{}" will be replaced by the portion of the glob matched
by the "*".  You can also chain one or more transformations inside the braces
separated by bars, e.g. "{dot|hyphenate}".  The complete list of available
transformations is as follows:

Name            Behavior ~
dot             / to .
underscore      / to _
backslash       / to \
colons          / to ::
hyphenate       _ to -
blank           _ and - to space
uppercase       uppercase
camelcase       foo_bar/baz_quux to fooBar/bazQuux
snakecase       FooBar/bazQuux to foo_bar/baz_quux
capitalize      capitalize first letter and each letter after a slash
dirname         remove last slash separated component
basename        remove all but last slash separated component
singular        singularize
plural          pluralize
file            absolute path to file
project         absolute path to project
open            literal {
close           literal }
nothing         empty string
vim             no-op (include to specify other implementations should ignore)

From a globbing perspective, "*" is actually a stand in for "**/*".  For
advanced cases, you can include both globs explicitly: "test/**/test_*.rb".
When expanding with {}, the ** and * portions are joined with a slash.  If
necessary, the dirname and basename expansions can be used to split the value
back apart.

The full list of available properties in a projection is as follows:

						*projectionist-alternate*
"alternate" ~
        Determines the destination of the |projectionist-:A| command.  If this
        is a list, the first readable file will be used.  Will also be used as
        a default for |projectionist-related|.
						*projectionist-console*
"console" ~
        Command to run to start a REPL or other interactive shell.  Will be
        defined as :Console.  This is useful to set from a "*" projection or
        on a simple file glob like "*.js".  Will also be used as a default for
        "start".  Expansions are shell escaped.
						*projectionist-dispatch*
"dispatch" ~
        Default task to use for |:Dispatch| in dispatch.vim.  If not provided,
        the option for any existing alternate file is used instead.
        Expansions are shell escaped.
						*projectionist-make*
"make" ~
        Sets 'makeprg'.  Also loads a |:compiler| plugin if one is available
        matching the executable name.  This is useful to set from a "*"
        projection.  Expansions are shell escaped.
						*projectionist-path*
"path" ~
        Additional directories to prepend to 'path'.  Can be relative to the
        project root or absolute.  This is useful to set on a simple file glob
        like "*.js".
						*projectionist-related*
"related" ~
        Indicates one or more files to search when a navigation command is
        called without an argument, to find a default destination.  Related
        files are searched recursively.
						*projectionist-start*
"start" ~
        Command to run to "boot" the project.  Examples include `lein run`,
        `rails server`, and `foreman start`.  It will be used as a default
        task for |:Start| in dispatch.vim.  This is useful to set from a "*"
        projection.  Expansions are shell escaped.
						*projectionist-template*
"template" ~
        Array of lines to use when creating a new file.
						*projectionist-type*
"type" ~
        Declares the type of file and create a set of navigation commands for
        opening files that match the glob.  If this option is provided for a
        literal filename rather than a glob, it is used as the default
        destination of the navigation command when no argument is given.  For
        a "type" value of "foo", the following navigation commands will be
        provided:
        `:Efoo`: delegates to |:edit|
        `:Sfoo`: delegates to |:split|
        `:Vfoo`: delegates to |:vsplit|
        `:Tfoo`: delegates to |:tabedit|
        `:Dfoo`: delegates to |:read|
        `:Ofoo`: delegates to |:drop|

                                                *g:projectionist_heuristics*
In addition to ".projections.json", projections can be defined globally
through use of the |projectionist-autocmds| API or through the variable
g:projectionist_heuristics, a |Dictionary| mapping between a string describing
the root of the project and a set of projections.  The keys of the dictionary
are files and directories that can be found in the root of a project, with &
separating multiple requirements and | separating multiple alternatives.  You
can also prefix a file or directory with ! to forbid rather than require its
presence.

In the example below, the first key requires a directory named
lib/heroku/ and a file named init.rb, and the second requires a directory
named etc/rbenv.d/ or one or more files matching the glob bin/rbenv-*.
>
    let g:projectionist_heuristics = {
          \ "lib/heroku/&init.rb": {
          \   "lib/heroku/command/*.rb": {"type": "command"}
          \ },
          \ "etc/rbenv.d/|bin/rbenv-*": {
          \   "bin/rbenv-*": {"type": "command"},
          \   "etc/rbenv.d/*.bash": {"type": "hook"}
          \ }}

Note the use of VimScript |line-continuation|.

COMMANDS                                        *projectionist-commands*

In addition to any navigation commands provided by your projections (see
|projectionist-type|), the following commands are available.

                                                *projectionist-:A*
:A                      Edit the alternate file for the current buffer, as
                        defined by the "alternate" key.

:A {file}               Edit {file} relative to the innermost root.
                                                *projectionist-:AS*
:AS [file]              Like :A, but open in a split.
                                                *projectionist-:AV*
:AV [file]              Like :A, but open in a vertical split.
                                                *projectionist-:AT*
:AT [file]              Like :A, but open in a tab.
                                                *projectionist-:AO*
:AO [file]              Like :A, but open using |:drop|.

                                                *projectionist-:AD*
:AD                     Replace the contents of the buffer with the new file
                        template.

:AD {file}              Like :A, but |:read| the file into the current buffer.

                                                *projectionist-:Pcd*
                                                *projectionist-:Cd*
:Pcd                     |:cd| to the innermost root.

:Pcd {path}              |:cd| to {path} in the innermost root.

                                                *projectionist-:Plcd*
                                                *projectionist-:Lcd*
:Plcd [path]             Like :Pcd, but use |:lcd|.

                                                *projectionist-:Ptcd*
                                                *projectionist-:Tcd*
:Ptcd [path]             Like :Pcd, but use |:tcd|.

                                                *projectionist-:ProjectDo*
:ProjectDo {cmd}        Change directory to the project root, execute the
                        given command, and change back.  This won't work if
                        {cmd} leaves the focus in a different window.  Tab
                        complete will erroneously reflect the current working
                        directory, not the project root.

AUTOCOMMANDS                                    *projectionist-autocmds*

Projectionist.vim dispatches a |User| *ProjectionistDetect* event when
searching for projections for a buffer.  You can call *projectionist#append()*
to register projections for the file found in *g:projectionist_file* .
>
    autocmd User ProjectionistDetect
          \ if SomeCondition(g:projectionist_file) |
          \   call projectionist#append(root, projections) |
          \ endif
<
The |User| *ProjectionistActivate* event is triggered when one or more sets of
projections are found.  You can call *projectionist#query()* to retrieve an
array of pairs of project roots and values for a given key.  Since typically
you only care about the first (most precisely targeted) value, the following
pattern may prove useful:
>
    autocmd User ProjectionistActivate call s:activate()

    function! s:activate() abort
      for [root, value] in projectionist#query('wrap')
        let &l:textwidth = value
        break
      endfor
    endfunction
<
You can also call *projectionist#path()* to get the root of the innermost set
of projections, which is useful for implementing commands like
|projectionist-:Pcd|.
