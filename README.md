## Tinted Terminal Background

This repository consolidates various terminal template repositories into
a single location, making them easier to maintain, especially since
terminal themes primarily adhere to the standard ANSI color styling with
limited additional customization options.

### 256-color themes

By default, the themes in the themes/ directory are designed for
terminals that support setting 256 ANSI colors.

These themes reuse 6 of the Base16 scheme colors twice: once for the
normal color variants (`Red`, `Green`, `Yellow`, `Blue`, etc) and again
for bright variants (`Bright Red`, `Bright Green`, `Bright Yellow`,
`Bright Blue`, etc). Base24 enables unique color values for the bright
color variants.

However, this approach leaves 6 colors from the Base16 scheme unused in
the terminal palette. To address this, we map these unused colors to the
extended ANSI color slots (16–21). This ensures that terminal app
creators can access the full set of colors when creating ANSI-color
passthrough themes.

### 16-color themes

Some terminals do not support extended ANSI-256 colors. In these cases,
Tinted Terminal themes only set the first 16 ANSI colors and ANSI colors
16-21 remain the default shades of blue. These 16-color Tinted Termianl
themes are located in the `themes-16/` directory.

For most users, there is no noticeable difference between the 256-color
and 16-color themes unless they are using CLI tool themes that
specifically rely on tinted-terminal's ANSI colors 16–21.

If you are using an ANSI passthrough theme that requires Tinted Terminal
ANSI colors 16–21, but you are using a terminal that does not support
setting these values, you can use [tinted-shell] to shim the missing
ANSI colors.

## Basic Tinty Usage Instructions

There are [Tinty] installation steps in the installation instructions
for most of the terminals. This will contain slightly more information
about it adding a Tinted Terminal theme to [Tinty].

1. Add the following `toml` settings to your Tinty
   `~/.config/tinted-theming/tinty/config.toml` file:

   ```toml
   [[items]]
   path = "https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-terminal"
   name = "tinted-terminal"
   themes-dir = "themes/alacritty" # Directory name of terminal theme you want to use
   supported-systems = ["base16", "base24"]
   ```

2. `tinty apply base16-ayu-dark` will create a theme file at
   `~/.local/share/tinted-theming/tinty/tinted-terminal-alacritty-file.toml`
   where `tinted-terminal-alacritty-file.toml` is made up of
   `<NAME>-<THEMES_DIR>-file.<FILE_EXTENSION>`:
      - `<NAME>` - The `name` property in `...tinty/config.toml`
      - `<THEMES_DIR>` - The `themes-dir` property in `...tinty/config.toml`
      - `<FILE_EXTENSION>` - The file extension of the theme file set by
        the template

<img src="./assets/alacritty-icon.svg" alt="Alacritty terminal logo" width="50"/>

Tinted Theming template for [Alacritty terminal emulator].

**Theme directory**: [themes/alacritty/]

### Tinty

1. Add the following to `~/.config/tinted-theming/tinty/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [[items]]
   path = "https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-terminal"
   name = "tinted-terminal"
   themes-dir = "themes/alacritty"
   hook = "cp -f %f ~/.config/alacritty/colors.toml && touch ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml"
   supported-systems = ["base16", "base24"]
   ```

2. Add the following to `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`:

   import = ["~/.config/alacritty/colors.toml"]
   ```

3. `tinty apply base16-ayu-dark` to change the theme to
   `base16-ayu-dark`

For more information on Tinty setup or usage, have a look at the [Tinty]
GitHub page.

### Manual

After cloning this repo, simply copy the contents of your desired theme
into your `alacritty.yml` configuration file. Make sure to remove or
comment out any previous theme.

## ConEmu

<img src="./assets/conemu-icon.png" alt="ConEmu terminal logo" width="50"/>

Tinted Theming template for [ConEmu terminal emulator].

**Theme directory**: [themes/conemu/]

### PowerShell install-script

The script will always create a backup of your config file as
`ConEmu.backup.xml` prior to doing anything. It's got two operation
modes:

#### Add theme

1. Run:

   ```ps1
   .\scripts\Install-ConEmuTheme.ps1 [-ConfigPath Path] -Operation Add -ThemePathOrName .\themes\base16-twilight.xml
   ```

2. Restart ConEmu and activate the color theme in `ConEmu Settings` ->
   `Features` -> `Colors` using the `Schemes` drop-down.

#### Remove theme

```ps1
.\scripts\Install-ConEmuTheme.ps1 [-ConfigPath Path] -Operation Remove -ThemePathOrName "base16-twilight"
```

**Note**: `-ConfigPath` argument is optional if your `ConEmu.xml` is
located at the default location
`C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming\ConEmu.xml`.

### Manual

1. Open `ConEmu.xml`. Usually it is at  `~\AppData\Roaming`, where `~`
   is your home directory (`C:\Users\UserName`).
2. Paste the color scheme at the end of palette settings part. It starts
   with the following:

   ```xml
   <key name="Colors" modified="2015-03-19 13:53:09" build="150310">
      <value name="Count" type="dword" data="00000001"/>
   <key name="Palette1" modified="2015-03-19 13:53:09" build="150310">
   ```

3. If you do not have any custom color scheme, the xml key is not there.
   In ConEmu, go to `Settings` -> `Feature` -> `Colors` and generate a
   custom color theme by click on `Save` button and specify any name.
   Then `Colors` key will be automatically generated in your
   `ConEmu.xml`. You can overwrite it when you add new themes.

4. Update the palette number (key name `PaletteX`) accordingly. For
   example, if you have 1 custom color palette already, it should be
   `Palette2` for the new one:

   ```xml
   <key name="Palette2" modified="2015-03-19 13:53:09" build="150310">
   ```

5. Make sure to increase the value for key name `Count` under key
   `Colors` as well. It should equal to the total number of pallets you
   have:

   ```xml
   <value name="Count" type="dword" data="00000002"/>
   ```

6. For example, the `Colors` part of your modified `ConEmu.xml` should
   look like this:

   ```xml
   <key name="Colors" modified="2015-03-19 13:53:09" build="150310">
       <value name="Count" type="dword" data="00000002"/>
       <key name="Palette1" modified="2015-03-19 13:53:09" build="150310">
           <value name="Name" type="string" data="EXISTING COLOR"/>
           <value name="ExtendColors" type="hex" data="00"/>
           ...
           <value name="ColorTable31" type="dword" data="00e3f6fd"/>
       </key>
       <key name="Palette2" modified="2015-03-19 13:53:09" build="150310">
           <value name="Name" type="string" data="NAME OF THE COLOR YOU ADDED"/>
           <value name="ExtendColors" type="hex" data="01"/>
           ...
           <value name="ColorTable31" type="dword" data="00e7fdfd"/>
       </key>
   </key>
   ```

Also, make sure that all the color options set to `Auto` to get correct
highlighting:

![color options]

### Color mapping

To see the current colors, run this PowerShell script:

```ps1
[enum]::GetValues([System.ConsoleColor]) | Foreach-Object {Write-Host $_ -ForegroundColor $_}
```

## Foot

<img src="./assets/foot-icon.svg" alt="Foot terminal logo" width="50"/>

Tinted Theming template for [Foot terminal emulator].

**Theme directory**: [themes/foot/]

### Tinty

If you use [Tinty] to apply your themes, complete the following steps to
update your theme when running `tinty apply base16-ayu-dark` (where
`base16-ayu-dark` is a placeholder scheme name):

1. Add the following to `~/.config/tinted-theming/tinty/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [[items]]
   path = "https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-terminal"
   name = "tinted-terminal"
   themes-dir = "themes/foot"
   supported-systems = ["base16", "base24"]
   ```

2. Add the following to `$HOME/.config/foot/foot.ini`:

   ```ini
   include=~/.local/share/tinted-theming/tinty/tinted-foot-colors-file.ini
   ```

3. `tinty apply base16-ayu-dark` to change the theme to
   `base16-ayu-dark`

For more information on Tinty setup or usage, have a look at the [Tinty]
GitHub page.

### Manual

Clone base16-foot to be able to reference the colorschemes.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-foot.git "$HOME/.config/tinted-theming/tinted-foot"
```

Include the following in your theme in your `foot.ini` (usually stored at
`$HOME/.config/foot/foot.ini`) under `[main]`, or the untitled section
at the beginning of the file.

```ini
include=~/.config/tinted-theming/tinted-foot/colors/base16-ayu-dark.ini
```

## Ghostty

<img src="./assets/ghostty-icon.png" alt="Ghostty terminal logo" width="50"/>

Tinted theming template for [Ghostty]

### Manual

Ghostty can auto-discover theme files located in the following directories:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes`
2. `$PREFIX/share/ghostty/themes`

You can simply download the theme you like into one of these directories and refer to it by filename in your main
Ghostty config, like so:

```ini
theme = base16-ayu-dark
```

### Tinty

1. Make sure this directory exists:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/ghostty/themes
   ```

1. Add the following to `~/.config/ghostty/config`:

    ```ini
    # Set `theme` to "tinted-theming":
    theme = "tinted-theming"
    ```

2. Add the following to `~/.config/tinted-theming/tinty/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [[items]]
   path = "https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-terminal"
   name = "tinted-terminal"
   themes-dir = "themes/ghostty"
   # With `theme` set to "tinted-theming", this will be where Ghostty looks for the theme file:
   hook = "command cp -f %f ~/.config/ghostty/themes/tinted-theming"
   supported-systems = ["base16", "base24"]
   ```

3. `tinty apply base16-ayu-dark` to change the theme to `base16-ayu-dark`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to trigger `reload_config` in Ghostty for the palette to apply. The default keybinding for this is `Cmd + Shift + ,` for macOS, or `Ctrl + Shift + ,` for Linux/Windows

### macOS

####  Auto `reload_config`

You can use AppleScript to tell Ghostty to reload the config e.g.:

```applescript
if application "Ghostty" is running then
   tell application "Ghostty" to activate
   delay 0.25
   tell application "System Events"
      -- The keymap for `reload_config` in Ghostty. Change this if necessary:
      keystroke "," using {shift down, command down}
   end tell
end if
```

Store this script somewhere on your machine, then after plugging in the correct keystroke to match the `reload_config` keymap for Ghostty (the above is the default), register a global hook in your Tinty config:

```toml
hooks = [
   "osascript -se ~/path/to/ghostty-reload-config.scrpt"
]
```

The next time you run `tinty apply`, Ghostty will prompt you for "App Management" permissions. Allow this to allow the hook to work going forward.

####  Customize Ghostty's app icon

By default, the theme files assigns `Bright White` and `Bright Blue` for the icon's ghost tint and screen tint,
respectively. If you'd like to use different colors, this repository provides scripts to generate a theme file with the
icon & screen tints you prefer. They are located in `./themes/ghostty-scripts` and can be used as follows:

##### Manual

```sh
# Example:
sh /path/to/tinted-terminal/themes/ghostty-scripts/base16-ayu-dark.sh \
   -g 5 \
   -s 16,12,10 \
   >! ~/.config/ghostty/themes/base16-ayu-dark
```

The above example would generate a `base16-ayu-dark` theme with `macos-icon-ghost-color` set to `palette[5]` color, and
`macos-icon-screen-color` set to a gradient of `palette[16]`, `palette[12]`, and `palette[10]`.

##### Tinty

Follow the same [Tinty instructions](#tinty-2), but put this in `~/.config/tinted-theming/tinty/config.toml` instead for
Step 2:

```toml
[[items]]
path = "https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-terminal"
name = "tinted-terminal"
themes-dir = "themes/ghostty-scripts"
# With `theme` set to "tinted-theming", this will be where Ghostty looks for the theme file:
hook = '''
sh %f \
   -g 5 \
   -s 16,12,10 \
   >! ~/.config/ghostty/themes/tinted-theming
'''
supported-systems = ["base16", "base24"]
```

Don’t forget to have this line on your main Ghostty configuration:

```ini
macos-icon = custom-style
```

## iTerm2

   instructions below under "Manual".
2. Applescripts that can be executed to change the iTerm2 theme.

**Theme directory**: [themes/iterm2/]

**Applescripts directory**: [themes-16/iterm2-applescripts/]

### Tinty

1. Add the following to `~/.config/tinted-theming/tinty/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [[items]]
   path = "https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-terminal"
   name = "tinted-terminal"
   themes-dir = "themes-16/iterm2-applescripts"
   hook = '''
   command cp -f %f ~/Library/Application\ Support/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch.scpt \
     && osascript %f
   '''
   supported-systems = ["base16", "base24"]
   ```

2. `tinty apply base16-ayu-dark` to change the theme to
   `base16-ayu-dark`

> [!NOTE]
>
> This also adds an item under the `Scripts` menu-bar item that can be invoked to re-apply the theme.
> You should be able to map a keyboard shortcut to trigger this as you like.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The AutoLaunch script is only ran at iTerm2 startup. It will not run when opening new windows or tabs.
> You may want to add the following line in your rc file:

```sh
# Only run if the shell is running in iTerm2.
if [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" = "iTerm.app" ]; then
    osascript "~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch.scpt"
fi
```

### Manual

## Kitty

<img src="./assets/kitty-icon.svg" alt="Kitty terminal logo" width="50"/>

Tinted Theming template for [Kitty terminal emulator].

Kitty will need to be restarted for changes to take effect. It is possible to remotely
trigger a conf-reload, but this requires kitty be started with the
feature `allow_remote_control=yes`.

```sh
kitty -o allow_remote_control=yes
```

### Tinty

1. Add the following to `~/.config/tinted-theming/tinty/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [[items]]
   path = "https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-terminal"
   name = "tinted-terminal"
   themes-dir = "themes/kitty"
   hook = "kitten @ load-config"
   supported-systems = ["base16", "base24"]
   ```

2. Add the following to `$HOME/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`:

   ```conf
   include ~/.local/share/tinted-theming/tinty/tinted-terminal-themes-kitty-file.conf
   ```

3. `tinty apply base16-ayu-dark` to change the theme to
   `base16-ayu-dark`

Note: If you don't have the Kitty feature `allow_remote_control`
enabled, Kitty should be manually restarted after using `tinty apply` to
set a new theme for it to take effect.

### Manual

Simply copy the contents of your desired color scheme into your kitty
configuration (`kitty.conf`). If you already have a color scheme defined,
remove it or comment it out before importing the new scheme.

Alternatively, you can include the theme conf file directly in
`$HOME/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`:

```conf
include /path/to/tinted-terminal/themes/kitty/base16-ayu-dark.conf
```

it does not exist), and the themes will be available under `Preferences > Colors > Presets`.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal
cp -r /path/to/tinted-xfce-terminal/colorschemes ~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal
```
