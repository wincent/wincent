## FAQ

***Why is it all in one repo now?***

Spec 0.10 was merged at the same time that base16 was forked from [Chris
Kempson's](https://github.com/chriskempson) account. One of the changes of this
version was moving all schemes to a single repo rather than separate repos and
the fork was chosen as a convenient time to do this.

When spec 0.11 was merged, we put schemes from all systems into one repo to
simplify builders.

[base16]: ./base16
[base24]: ./base24
