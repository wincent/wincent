### X11

[x11](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/xdotool.1.html) is *not* the default, to use it you will have to add this line to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:slime_target = "x11"
```

When you invoke `vim-slime` for the first time, you will have to designate a target window by clicking on it.

#### Troubleshooting
If `SlimeConfig` hangs without asking you to select a target terminal, you may not have `xdotool` installed.

If `SlimeConfig` works and you can send text to the terminal window running vim but not to other terminal windows, your terminal may be configured to ignore the XSendEvent events generated by `xdotool` by default. See the SENDEVENT NOTES section of the [xdotool man page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/xdotool.1.html#SendEventNotes) for details. Note also that allowing arbitrary programs to send text to your terminal to be executed is potentially a security vulnerability.
