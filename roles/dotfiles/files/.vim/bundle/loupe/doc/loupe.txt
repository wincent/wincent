INTRO                                                             *loupe-intro*

    "loupe (noun)
    a small magnifying glass used by jewelers and watchmakers."

                                                               *loupe-features*
Loupe enhances Vim's |search-commands| in four ways:

1. Makes the currently selected match easier to see ~

When searching using |/|, |?|, |star|, |#|, |n|, |N| or similar, it can be hard to see
the "current" match from among all the matches that 'hlsearch' highlights.
Loupe makes the currently selected match easier to see by:

- Applying a different |:highlight| group (by default, |hl-IncSearch|) to the
  match under the cursor.
- Keeping the matching line centered within the window when jumping between
  matches with |n| and |N|.

2. Applies sane pattern syntax by default ~

Loupe makes "very magic" (|/\v|) syntax apply by default when searching. This
is true even if you initiate a search via a novel means, such as from a visual
selection or with a complicated |:range| prefix.

This means that you can use a pattern syntax closer to the familiar regular
expression syntax from languages such as Perl, Ruby, JavaScript (indeed, most
other modern languages that support regular expressions).

3. Provides a shortcut to remove search highlighting ~

Loupe maps <leader>n to quickly remove all 'hlsearch' highlighting (although
you can provide an alternative mapping of your choosing or suppress the
feature entirely).

4. Sensible defaults for search-related features ~

Loupe provides reasonable defaults for most search-related Vim settings to
provide a good "out of the box" experience. For more details, or to see how to
override Loupe's settings, see |loupe-overrides|.


INSTALLATION                                               *loupe-installation*

To install Loupe, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice", I recommend
Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and that
you want to install Loupe into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with: >

  git clone https://github.com/wincent/loupe.git ~/.vim/bundle/loupe

Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject: >

  git submodule add loupe https://github.com/wincent/loupe.git ~/vim/bundle/loupe
  git submodule init

To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with: >

  :call pathogen#helptags()


OPTIONS                                                         *loupe-options*

                                                        *g:LoupeHighlightGroup*
  |g:LoupeHighlightGroup|                           string (default: IncSearch)

  Specifies the |:highlight| group used to emphasize the match currently under
  the cursor for the current search pattern. Defaults to "IncSearch" (ie.
  |hl-IncSearch|). For example: >

    let g:LoupeHighlightGroup='Error'
<
  To prevent any special highlighting from being applied, set this option to
  "" (ie. the empty string).

                                                             *g:LoupeVeryMagic*
  |g:LoupeVeryMagic|                                       boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether "very magic" pattern syntax (|/\v|) is applied by default.
  To disable, set to 0: >

    let g:LoupeVeryMagic=0
<
                                                         *g:LoupeCenterResults*
  |g:LoupeCenterResults|                                   boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether the match's line is vertically centered within the window
  when jumping (via |n|, |N| etc). To disable, set to 0: >

    let g:LoupeCenterResults=0
<
                                                     *g:LoupeClearHighlightMap*
  |g:LoupeClearHighlightMap|                               boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether to set up the |<Plug>LoupeClearHighlight| mapping. To
  prevent any mapping from being configured, set to 0: >

    let g:LoupeClearHighlightMap=0
<
                                                                *g:LoupeLoaded*
  |g:LoupeLoaded|                                              any (no default)

  To prevent Loupe from being loaded, set |g:LoupeLoaded| to any value in your
  |.vimrc|. For example: >

    let g:LoupeLoaded=1


MAPPINGS                                                       *loupe-mappings*

                                                    *<Plug>LoupeClearHighlight*
Loupe maps <leader>n to |<Plug>LoupeClearHighlight|, which clears all visible
highlights (like |:nohighlight| does). To use an alternative mapping instead,
create a different one in your |.vimrc| instead using |:nmap|: >

  " Instead of <leader>n, use <leader>x.
  nmap <leader>x <Plug>LoupeClearHighlight

Note that Loupe will not try to set up its <leader>n mapping if any of the
following are true:

- A mapping for <leader>n already exists.
- An alternative mapping for |<Plug>LoupeClearHighlight| has already been set
  up from a |.vimrc|.
- The mapping has been suppressed by setting |g:LoupeClearHighlightMap| to 1
  in your |.vimrc|.


OVERRIDES                                                     *loupe-overrides*

Loupe sets a number of search-related Vim settings to reasonable defaults in
order to provide a good "out of the box" experience:

                                                               *loupe-history*
  'history'

  Increased to 1000, to increase the number of previous searches remembered.
  Note that Loupe only applies this setting if the current value of 'history'
  is less than 1000.

                                                               *loupe-hlsearch*
  'hlsearch'

  Turned on (when there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its
  matches).

                                                              *loupe-incsearch*
  'incsearch'

  Turned on (while typing a search command, show where the pattern matches, as
  it was typed so far).

                                                             *loupe-ignorecase*
  'ignorecase'

  Turned on (to ignore case in search patterns).

                                                              *loupe-shortmess*
  'shortmess'

  Adds "s", which suppresses the display of "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at
  TOP" and "search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages.

                                                              *loupe-smartcase*
  'smartcase'

  Turned on (overrides 'ignorecase', making the search pattern case-sensitive
  whenever it containers uppercase characters).

To override any of these choices, you can place overrides in an
|after-directory| (ie. `~/.vim/after/plugin/loupe.vim`). For example: >

  " Override Loupe's 'history' setting from 1000 to 10000.
  set history=10000

  " Reset Loupe's 'incsearch' back to Vim default.
  set incsearch&vim

  " Remove unwanted 's' from 'shortmess'.
  set shortmess-=s

Loupe is written and maintained by Greg Hurrell <greg@hurrell.net>.

The original idea for the |g:LoupeHighlightGroup| feature was taken from
Damian Conway's Vim set-up:

  https://github.com/thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup/blob/master/plugin/hlnext.vim

Which he discussed in his "More Instantly Better Vim" presentation at OSCON
2013:
