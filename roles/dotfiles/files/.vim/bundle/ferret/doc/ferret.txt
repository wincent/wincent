INTRO                                                            *ferret-intro*

    "ferret (verb)
    (ferret something out) search tenaciously for and find something: she had
    the ability to ferret out the facts."

                                                              *ferret-features*
Ferret improves Vim's multi-file search in four ways:

1. Powerful multi-file search ~

Ferret provides an |:Ack| command for searching across multiple files using
The Silver Searcher (https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), Ack
(http://beyondgrep.com/), or Grep (http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/). Support
for passing options through to the underlying search command exists, along
with the ability to use full regular expression syntax without doing special
escaping.

Shortcut mappings are provided to start an |:Ack| search (<leader>a) or to
search for the word currently under the cursor (<leader>s).

Results are normally displayed in the |quickfix| window, but Ferret also
provides a |:Lack| command that behaves like |:Ack| but uses the
|location-list| instead, and a <leader>l mapping as a shortcut to |:Lack|.

Finally, Ferret offers integration with dispatch.vim
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch), which enables asynchronous searching
despite the fact that Vim itself is single-threaded.

2. Streamlined multi-file replace ~

The companion to |:Ack| is |:Acks| (mnemonic: "Ack substitute"), which allows
you to run a multi-file replace across all the files placed in the |quickfix|
window by a previous invocation of |:Ack|.

3. Quickfix listing enhancements ~

The |quickfix| listing itself is enhanced with settings to improve its
usability, and natural mappings that allow quick removal of items from the
list (for example, you can reduce clutter in the listing by removing lines
that you don't intend to make changes to).

Additionally, Vim's |:cn|, |:cp|, |:cnf| and |:cpf| commands are tweaked to
make it easier to immediately identify matches by centering them within the
viewport.

4. Easy operations on files in the quickfix listing ~

Finally, Ferret provides a |:Qargs| command that puts the files currently in
the |quickfix| listing into the |:args| list, where they can be operated on in
bulk via the |:argdo| command. This is what's used under the covers by |:Acks|
to do its work.


INSTALLATION                                              *ferret-installation*

To install Ferret, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice", I recommend
Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and that
you want to install Ferret into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with: >

  git clone https://github.com/wincent/ferret.git ~/.vim/bundle/ferret

Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject: >

  git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/ferret.git ~/vim/bundle/ferret
  git submodule init

To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with: >

  :call pathogen#helptags()


COMMANDS                                                      *ferret-commands*

:Ack {pattern} {options}                                                 *:Ack*
              Searches for {pattern} in all the files under the current
              directory (see |:pwd|), unless otherwise overridden via
              {options}, and displays the results in the |quickfix| listing.

              `ag` (The Silver Searcher) will be used preferentially if
              present on the system, because it is faster, falling back to
              `ack` and then `grep` as needed.

              If dispatch.vim is installed the search process will run
              asynchronously via the |:Make| command, otherwise it will be run
              synchronously via |:cexpr|. Asynchronous searches are preferred
              because they do not block, despite the fact that Vim itself is
              single threaded. The |g:FerretDispatch| option can be used to
              prevent the use of dispatch.vim.

              The {pattern} is passed through as-is to the underlying search
              program, and no escaping is required other than preceding spaces
              by a single backslash. For example, to search for
              "\bfoo[0-9]{2} bar\b" (ie. using `ag`'s Perl-style regular
              expression syntax), you could do: >

                :Ack \bfoo[0-9]{2}\ bar\b
<
              Likewise, {options} are passed through. In this example, we pass
              the `-w` option (to search on word boundaries), and scope the
              search to the "foo" and "bar" subdirectories: >

                :Ack -w something foo bar
<
              As a convenience <leader>a is set-up (|<Plug>(FerretAck)|) as a
              shortcut to enter |Cmdline-mode| with `:Ack` inserted on the
              |Cmdline|. Likewise <leader>s (|<Plug>(FerretAckWord)|) is a
              shortcut for running |:Ack| with the word currently under the
              cursor.

:Acks /{pattern}/{replacement}/                                         *:Acks*
              Takes all of the files currently in the |quickfix| listing and
              performs a substitution of all instances of {pattern} (a
              standard Vim search |pattern|) by {replacement}.

              A typical sequence consists of an |:Ack| invocation to populate
              the |quickfix| listing and then |:Acks| (mnemonic: "Ack
              substitute") to perform replacements. For example, to replace
              "foo" with "bar" across all files in the current directory: >

                :Ack foo
                :Acks /foo/bar/

:Lack {pattern} {options}                                               *:Lack*
              Just like |:Ack|, but instead of using the |quickfix| listing,
              which is global across an entire Vim instance, it uses the
              |location-list|, which is a per-window construct.

              Note that |:Lack| always runs synchronously via |:cexpr|,
              because dispatch.vim doesn't currently support the
              |location-list|.

                                                                       *:Qargs*
:Qargs        This is a utility function that is used by the |:Acks| command
              but is also generally useful enough to warrant being exposed
              publicly.

              It takes the files currently in the |quickfix| listing and sets
              them as |:args| so that they can be operated on en masse via the
              |:argdo| command.


OPTIONS                                                        *ferret-options*

                                                                  *g:FerretMap*
  |g:FerretMap|                                            boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether to set up the Ferret mappings, such as |<Plug>(FerretAck)|
  (see |ferret-mappings| for a full list). To prevent any mapping from being
  configured, set to 0: >

    let g:FerretMap=0
<
                                                             *g:FerretDispatch*
  |g:FerretDispatch|                                       boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether to use vim-dispatch (and specifically, |:Make|) to run
  |:Ack| searches asynchronously, when available. To prevent vim-dispatch from
  being used, set to 0: >

    let g:FerretDispatch=0
<
                                                           *g:FerretQFCommands*
  |g:FerretQFCommands|                                     boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether to set up custom versions of the |quickfix| commands, |:cn|,
  |:cnf|, |:cp| an |:cpf|. These overrides vertically center the match within
  the viewport on each jump. To prevent the custom versions from being
  configured, set to 0: >

    let g:FerretQFCommands=0
<
                                                                *g:FerretQFMap*
  |g:FerretQFMap|                                          boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether to set up mappings in the |quickfix| results window for
  deleting results. The mappings include:

    - `d` (|visual-mode|): delete visual selection
    - `dd` (|Normal-mode|): delete current line
    - `d`{motion} (|Normal-mode|): delete range indicated by {motion}

  To prevent these mappings from being set up, set to 0: >

    let g:FerretQFMap=0
<
                                                            *g:FerretQFOptions*
  |g:FerretQFOptions|                                      boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether to set up setting overrides for |quickfix| windows. These
  are various settings, such as |norelativenumber|, |nolist| and |nowrap|,
  that are intended to make the |quickfix| window, which is typically very
  small relative to other windows, more usable.

  A full list of overridden settings can be found in |ferret-overrides|.

  To prevent the custom settings from being applied, set |g:FerretQFOptions|
  to 0: >

    let g:FerretQFOptions=0
<
                                                               *g:FerretLoaded*
  |g:FerretLoaded|                                             any (no default)

  To prevent Ferret from being loaded, set |g:FerretLoaded| to any value in your
  |.vimrc|. For example: >

    let g:FerretLoaded=1


MAPPINGS                                                      *ferret-mappings*

                                                            *<Plug>(FerretAck)*
Ferret maps <leader>a to |<Plug>(FerretAck)|, which triggers the |:Ack|
command. To use an alternative mapping instead, create a different one in your
|.vimrc| instead using |:nmap|: >

  " Instead of <leader>a, use <leader>x.
  nmap <leader>x <Plug>(FerretAck)
<

                                                           *<Plug>(FerretLack)*
Ferret maps <leader>l to |<Plug>(FerretLack)|, which triggers the |:Lack|
command. To use an alternative mapping instead, create a different one in your
|.vimrc| instead using |:nmap|: >

  " Instead of <leader>l, use <leader>y.
  nmap <leader>y <Plug>(FerretLack)
<
                                                        *<Plug>(FerretAckWord)*
Ferret maps <leader>s to |<Plug>(FerretAckWord)|, which uses |:Ack| to search
for the word currently under the cursor. To use an alternative mapping
instead, create a different one in your |.vimrc| instead using |:nmap|: >

  " Instead of <leader>s, use <leader>z.
  nmap <leader>z <Plug>(FerretAckWord)

Circumstances where mappings do not get set up ~

Note that Ferret will not try to set up the <leader> mappings if any of the
following are true:

- A mapping for already exists.
- An alternative mapping for the same functionality has already been set up
  from a |.vimrc|.
- The mapping has been suppressed by setting |g:FerretMap| to 1 in your
  |.vimrc|.

Mappings specific to the quickfix window ~

Additionally, Ferret will set up special mappings in |quickfix| listings,
unless prevented from doing so by |g:FerretQFMap|:

  - `d` (|visual-mode|): delete visual selection
  - `dd` (|Normal-mode|): delete current line
  - `d`{motion} (|Normal-mode|): delete range indicated by {motion}


OVERRIDES                                                    *ferret-overrides*

Ferret overrides the 'grepformat' and 'grepprg' settings, preferentially
setting `ag`, `ack` or `grep` as the 'grepprg' (in that order) and configuring
a suitable 'grepformat'.

Additionally, Ferret includes an |ftplugin| for the |quickfix| listing that
adjusts a number of settings to improve the usability of search results.

                                                                *ferret-nolist*
  'nolist'

  Turned off to reduce visual clutter in the search results, and because
  'list' is most useful in files that are being actively edited, which is not
  the case for |quickfix| results.

                                                      *ferret-norelativenumber*
  'norelativenumber'

  Turned off, because it is more useful to have a sense of absolute progress
  through the results list than to have the ability to jump to nearby results
  (especially seeing as the most common operations are moving to the next or
  previous file, which are both handled nicely by |:cnf| and |:cpf|
  respectively).

                                                                *ferret-nowrap*
  'nowrap'

  Turned off to avoid ugly wrapping that makes the results list hard to read,
  and because in search results, the most relevant information is the
  filename, which is on the left and is usually visible even without wrapping.

                                                                *ferret-number*
  'number'

  Turned on to give a sense of absolute progress through the results.

                                                             *ferret-scrolloff*
  'scrolloff'

  Set to 0 because the |quickfix| listing is usually small by default, so
  trying to keep the current line away from the edge of the viewpoint is
  futile; by definition it is usually near the edge.

                                                          *ferret-nocursorline*
  'nocursorline'

  Turned off to reduce visual clutter.

To prevent any of these |quickfix|-specific overrides from being set up, you
can set |g:FerretQFOptions| to 0 in your |.vimrc|: >

  let g:FerretQFOptions=0
