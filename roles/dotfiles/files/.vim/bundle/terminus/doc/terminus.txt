INTRO                                                          *terminus-intro*

    "terminus (noun, pl. termini or terminuses)
    the end of a railroad or other transportation route, or a station at such
    a point; a terminal."

                                                            *terminus-features*
Terminus enhances Vim's integration with the terminal in four ways,
particularly when using tmux (https://tmux.github.io/) and iTerm
(https://www.iterm2.com/), closing the gap between terminal and GUI Vim:

1. Cursor shape change in insert mode ~

In insert mode, the cursor shape changes to a thin vertical bar. On leaving
inset mode, it reverts to the standard "block" shape.

2. Improved mouse support ~

Activates 'mouse' support in all modes and additionally tries to activate
|sgr-mouse| support, which allows the mouse to work "even in columns beyond
223".

3. Focus reporting ~

Allows Vim to receive |FocusGained| and |FocusLost| events, even in the
terminal and inside tmux. This is in turn used to fire the |:checktime|
command, which, in conjunction with the 'autoread', allows Vim to
automatically pick up changes made by other processes when switching to and
from Vim.

4. "Bracketed Paste" mode ~

Sets up "Bracketed Paste" mode, which means you can forget about manually
setting the 'paste' option and simply go ahead and paste in any mode.


INSTALLATION                                            *terminus-installation*

To install Terminus, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice", I recommend
Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and that
you want to install Terminus into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with: >

  git clone https://github.com/wincent/terminus.git ~/.vim/bundle/terminus

Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject: >

  git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/terminus.git ~/vim/bundle/terminus
  git submodule init

To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with: >

  :call pathogen#helptags()


OPTIONS                                                      *terminus-options*

                                                        *g:TerminusCursorShape*
  |g:TerminusCursorShape|                                  boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether cursor shape changes are made when entering or leaving
  insert mode. To disable, set to 0: >

    let g:TerminusCursorShape=0
<
                                                              *g:TerminusMouse*
  |g:TerminusMouse|                                         boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether Terminus attempts to improve mouse function by setting the
  'mouse' and 'typemouse' settings. To disable this action, set to 0: >

    let g:TerminusMouse=0
<
                                                     *g:TerminusFocusReporting*
  |g:TerminusFocusReporting|                               boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether Terminus attempts to enable focus reporting and therefore
  |FocusGained| and |FocusLost| events, which then trigger the |:checktime|
  command and allow changed files to be refreshed automatically via
  'autoread'. To disable this feature, set to 0: >

    let g:TerminusFocusReporting=0
<
                                                     *g:TerminusBracketedPaste*
  |g:TerminusBracketedPaste|                               boolean (default: 1)

  Controls whether Terminus attempts to set-up Bracketed Paste mode. To
  disable, set to 0: >

    let g:TerminusBracketedPaste=0
<
                                                        *terminus-assume-iterm*
                                                        *g:TerminusAssumeITerm*
  |g:TerminusAssumeITerm|                                      any (no default)

  Terminus will try to autodetect when Vim is running inside of iTerm,
  but it is possible that when running on a remote host via SSH the necessary
  environment variables (`$ITERM_PROFILE` or `$ITERM_SESSION_ID`) may not be
  present.

  In this case, it is possible to signal to Terminus that iTerm is operative by
  doing either of the following:

  - Touching (ie. creating) a file at `~/.vim/.assume-iterm`.
  - Setting |g:TerminusAssumeITerm| to any value

                                                             *g:TerminusLoaded*
  |g:TerminusLoaded|                                           any (no default)

  To prevent Terminus from being loaded, set |g:TerminusLoaded| to any value
  in your |.vimrc|. For example: >

    let g:TerminusLoaded=1
<

OVERRIDES                                                  *terminus-overrides*

Terminus sets some Vim settings to reasonable defaults in order to provide a
good "out of the box" experience:

                                                            *terminus-autoread*
  'autoread'

  Turned on (if a file change made outside of Vim is detected as the result of
  running the |:checktime| command, reloads the file).

                                                         *terminus-ttimeoutlen*
  'ttimeoutlen'

  Reduced to 50 (milliseconds) to speed of the response of some mappings (for
  example, |O|) in the terminal. If the effective 'ttimeoulen' is already 50
  or lower, Terminus leaves this setting untouched.

To override any of these choices, you can place overrides in an
|after-directory| (ie. `~/.vim/after/plugin/terminus.vim`). For example: >

  " Override Terminus' 'autoread' setting.
  set noautoread
