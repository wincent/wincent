/**
 * Summary of differences between actual and desired state of a file-system
 * object (ie. a file, directory, or link).
 *
 * Notable properties:
 *
 * -  error: Set if there is some reason why the comparison could not be
 *    completed or the desired end-state cannot be produced (for
 *    example, if we desired an object with a "state" of "file" at
 *    "a/b/c", but there is already a file at "a/b", that will be an
 *    error).
 * -  force: When `true`, user is asking to create a symlink even if the
 *    target doesn't exist, and even if there is a file already at the
 *    destination (which would need to be removed for link creation to
 *    succeed). In the result, set to `true` to signal that a target
 *    will need to be removed (for example, to replace a link with a
 *    directory), or force-written (for example, to replace a file with
 *    a link; ie. `ln -sf`) etc.
 *
 * In general, if a property is unset, that means no changes are
 * required with respect to that property.
