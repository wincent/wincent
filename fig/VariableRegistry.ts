/**
 * Manages variables within the precedence system laid out in "fig/README.md";
 * the system consists of the following types, from lowest to highest
 * precedence:
 *
 * 1. Base variables (eg. "profile")
 * 2. Attributes
 * 3. Top-level defaults (from "fig.config.ts")
 * 4. Profile-level variables (also from "fig.config.ts")
 * 5. Platform-level variables (also from "fig.config.ts")
 * 6. Dynamic variables (computed in the top-level "variables.ts" file)
 * 7. Aspect-level static variables (from "aspect.json" or "aspect.ts")
 * 8. Aspect-level derived variables (via `variables()` DSL calls in "index.ts")
 *
 * Within that system, `VariableRegistry` manages three kinds of variables:
 *
 * - "Global" variables: These correspond to variables which apply everywhere
 *   and are not aspect-specific. That is, levels 1 through 6. To manage these,
 *   the class provides a once-only `registerGlobalVariables()` method that is
 *   called during start-up from "main.ts", before any tasks actually run.
 * - "Derived" variables: These are the optional aspect-specific variables
 *   defined at level 8. Aspects which use the `variables()` DSL register their
 *   callbacks using the `registerVariablesCallback()` method. "main.ts" calls
 *   the appropriate callback while preparing to run a task, mixing the result
 *   in to produce the final set of variables.
 * - "Final" variables: Are the composition of all levels 1 through 8. "main.ts"
 *   calls `registerFinalVariables()` before running each task so that various
 *   aspect-aware parts of the codebase can look up the current applicable set
 *   of all variables with a simple `Context.currentVariables` access.
